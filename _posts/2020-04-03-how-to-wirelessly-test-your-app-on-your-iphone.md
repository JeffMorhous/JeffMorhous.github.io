A good thing to note is that the mac you are using Xcode on and the iPhone (or iPad) you want to test on  **must be on the same network**.

Next to the build button, go to select a device/simulator. Here, mine just says “_Generic iOS Device_”

Once you click on it, select “_Add Additional Simulators_” The result will be a modal that looks like this.

Go ahead and switch over to devices. Plug your device in and unlock it, and it should appear.

Go ahead and click the checkbox that says “_Connect via network_” and voila!

You may have to restart Xcode, but you should now be able to run your apps on your device without physically connecting it!

This is a pretty small trick but it may save you tons of time, and honestly it’s just too cool not to set up. Hope this helped, and if you ran in to trouble, let me know below!
