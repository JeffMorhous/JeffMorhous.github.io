[**Vue.js**](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)  is an open source JavaScript framework created and maintained by a vibrant and passionate community. Although it‚Äôs  _relatively_ new to the web apps world, Vue is quickly gaining ground on the more popular alternatives, React and Angular.

While remarkably useful, Vue.js by itself isn‚Äôt necessarily pretty. Sure, we could build out all the components we need, customizing CSS to fit our design patterns, but there‚Äôs a far easier way.  [**Vuetify**](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)  is a component framework that follows Material Design concepts. In short, it‚Äôs a massive UI library that plays really nicely with Vue. Things like forms, buttons, app bars, and even spinners can be used almost instantly, accelerating our front-end labor to an unbelievable pace. Beyond this, it all but ensures we‚Äôre following a consistent design pattern, which boosts our user experience!

Now, let‚Äôs get down to it.

----------

## Step 0 (optional): Version Control üí™

It‚Äôs always a good idea to start version control when you start your project. Head over to github.com and create a new repository with whatever name you want. Click the ‚ÄúInitialize this repository with a README‚Äù button, then hit ‚ÄúCreate Repository‚Äù

Creating a new repository on Github

Next clone your repo either via SSH or HTTP from the command line with

    $ git clone <the-link-github-provides>

In your terminal, move into the directory that just got cloned with

    $ cd <my-repo-name>

If you‚Äôre not familiar with git and want to be,  [‚ÄúGit-it‚Äù is a wonderful tutorial](http://jlord.us/git-it/)  that runs you through most everything you‚Äôll need to get started.

## Step 1: Install Vue Cli

Vue CLI (command line interface) is by far the fastest and easiest way to create the scaffolding needed for a Vue.js project.

There‚Äôs some  [documentation on installing it here](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html), but if you have npm installed already, it‚Äôs as simple as running the following in our terminal

    $ npm install -g @vue/cli

## Step 2: Create Vue Project

Now that we have the command line interface installed, to create a new project, we just need to run the following in the command line.

    $ vue create my-app

You should replace ‚Äúmy-app‚Äù with your desired app name of course! You‚Äôll be prompted for some customization options here, but I‚Äôve always been happy with the defaults.

Fire up your code editor of choice. For most things,  [I use VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It‚Äôs lightweight and incredibly customizable, not to mention free, perfect for Vue.js development.

You now have a functional Vue.js app created! This is a great place to commit üòÉ

## Step 3: Add Vuetify üîÆ

Move your working directory into the app that was just created with (of course, replace my-app with the name you gave the  _vue create_  command)

    $ cd my-app

Then, we can set up our app to use Vuetify by simply running the following command

    $ vue add vuetify

To see your new beautiful web app, run the start script (either yarn serve or npm run dev) and view it in your browser!

Just like the command line tool recommends, this is a great place to commit your changes

## Step 4 and Beyond: Adding Components and Customization

Now that you have Vuetify hooked up to Vue, adding crazy complex and appealing components is as easy as one liners. Go through the documentation and see what components might be useful to you. Take a look at the resources below to see what you can do. Actually getting components to do things is more of a Vue.js skill, so their docs and various tutorials will be helpful to you.
