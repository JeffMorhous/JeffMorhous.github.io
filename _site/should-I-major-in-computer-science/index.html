                <p>I‚Äôm in my fourth year studying Computer Science (and Engineering ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), and I‚Äôm certain this was the right move for me. But is a degree in Computer Science the right path for you? Is Computer Science a good major?</p>

<p>For me, the decision was all but obvious once I eliminated some other career options‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI love to build things, and I love to work with people. Working as a Software Engineer seems like a natural choice. The most common degree for people pursuing a career in Software Engineering is a B.S. in Computer Science, so that‚Äôs what I looked for!</p>

<h3 id="should-you-follow-your-passion">Should you follow your passion?</h3>

<p>Yes, and no. Following your passion is often dangerous, as Cal Newport argues in his book, ‚ÄúSo Good They Can‚Äôt Ignore You.‚Äù A distinguished Professor of Computer Science and popular author, he argues that skills trump passion in the quest for work that matters.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, we work for money. We used to have to hunt or grow our own food, fending for all of our most basic resources. Now, most of us specialize in more specific work, like carpentry, teaching, marketing, or programming. We trade our time and skills for money, which we trade for the things we want and need. You can talk all day about doing a job because we love it, but if the paycheck stopped coming, I‚Äôd bet you‚Äôd be looking for a job you loved <em>that payed you</em>.</p>

<p>Even so, no person <em>wants</em> to spend a giant portion of their life slaving away doing work they hate. We gravitate towards work that fulfills us. <strong>So to answer the question ‚ÄúShould I major in Computer Science,‚Äù you have to answer the question, ‚ÄúWill this lead me to a career that is fulfilling, stable, and financially attractive?‚Äù</strong> Obviously, the answer varies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I hope to help you find yours.</p>

<p>Cal Newport follows up his denial of ‚ÄúFollow your passion‚Äù with the assertion that in order to find work that fulfills us, we need to first acquire rare and valuable skills, something he calls ‚ÄúCareer capital.‚Äù You need to give employers or clients a reason to trust you with autonomy and pay you well, and for that, you need a track record of success. For some people, college is a great step to establishing that track record while acquiring those rare and valuable skills.</p>

<h3 id="will-you-enjoy-working-in-computer-science">Will You Enjoy Working In Computer Science?</h3>

<p>The easiest way to pick your major (and know if you even <em>need</em> to go to college) is to decide on your career. Plenty of people find their career after they pick a school and major, and that‚Äôs just as valid. However, if you‚Äôre already considering Computer Science, narrowing down your desired occupation is a natural first step. Here‚Äôs a list of just 10 job titles people in Computer Science tend to gravitate to -</p>

<ol>
  <li>Software Developer (or Engineer)</li>
  <li>Database Administrator</li>
  <li>Computer Hardware Engineer</li>
  <li>Computer Hardware Engineer</li>
  <li>Computer Hardware Engineer</li>
  <li>Web Developer</li>
  <li>Information Security Analyst</li>
  <li>Computer and Information Research Scientists</li>
  <li>Computer and Information Systems Managers</li>
  <li>IT Project Manager</li>
</ol>

<p>If any of these roles interest you, you can <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/top-jobs-for-computer-science-majors-2059634">find more information here</a>!</p>

<p>All of these titles are great places to start in your search for work that you‚Äôll love, if you feel inclined to them. Even so, you‚Äôll need to work hard and build a reputation for yourself before you reap most of the benefits of this ‚Äúcareer capital.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="do-you-like-to-code">Do You Like To Code?</h3>

<p>Not everyone who studies computer science is writing code all day. In fact, pretty much everyone will have to face more soft-skill oriented tasks, like participating in meetings and working with colleagues. However I‚Äôm pretty comfortable saying that if you don‚Äôt like computers, or the thought of sitting in front of a computer for most of your workday is dreadful, this probably isn‚Äôt the career you want.</p>

<p>During my internships, I spent a lot of time writing code, but even more time working with teammates. Programming isn‚Äôt a solo sport, and that‚Äôs a good thing. So, if you‚Äôre great at working with people, and you don‚Äôt hate computers, give yourself a chance.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-youre-bad-at-math">What If You‚Äôre Bad At Math?</h3>

<p>Working in tech or software is one thing, but studying Computer Science is another. In my professional work, I pretty much never explicitly call on my math knowledge. An understanding of mathematics at an algebra level is likely enough for you to be able to write quality software, but it won‚Äôt make you a ‚ÄúComputer Scientist.‚Äù</p>

<p>Any accredited Computer Science degree is going to require a ton of math. Like, enough math where it wouldn‚Äôt be much extra work to pick up a math minor. You don‚Äôt have to love math to succeed, I certainly don‚Äôt. In fact, I‚Äôm not even particularly good at math. I failed Calculus 3 actually‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI had to take it again. I worked hard, filled gaps in my knowledge, and came out of it with an A. While that one failed course hurt my GPA, I honestly don‚Äôt believe it indicates that I‚Äôm any worse at my job. I view it as a learning experience, and a refinement of my work ethic. Math is really hard for me, and I work my butt off to get through it.</p>

<p>When I graduate, I can move on from math. Sure, jobs will often you to understand Computer Science related math (things like graph theory, limits, and maybe even probability), but I believe employers value work ethic over natural ability.</p>

<p>You do have to command an ability in analytical thinking though. Programming is just telling computers what to do, and that requires a firm grasp on logic. This is something that can be learned, but if you absolutely hate the idea of puzzles, logic, and problem solving, you‚Äôre starting at an incredible disadvantage.</p>

<p>Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard. So no, don‚Äôt let not ‚Äúbeing a math person‚Äù stop you from pursuing a career you want.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-other-majors">What About Other Majors?</h3>

<p>I decided on my major and on my school at the same time, and I would definitely recommend that to anyone who hasn‚Äôt graduated high school yet.</p>

<p>If a career in software is exciting to you, you don‚Äôt exactly have to study Computer Science. In fact, a diverse background makes for a strong team, and if you can learn the technical skills on your own, a different major won‚Äôt work too much against you.</p>

<p>It happens to be a bit easier to land an entry level job in software when you have a piece of paper that at least says, ‚ÄúI passed a lot of tests about skills this job requires,‚Äù so there is definitely value in studying relevant to the job you want.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-decide-if-cs-is-the-right-major">How To Decide If CS Is The Right Major</h3>

<p>I bet you came here looking for me to say ‚ÄúYes you should major in CS‚Äù, or ‚ÄúNo, you shouldn‚Äôt even go to college,‚Äù but I‚Äôm not going to do that. Sorry ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>Your career is an exceptionally personal journey, but it shouldn‚Äôt define you. Figure out what‚Äôs important to you in work. Decide how you want your days to look. If that aligns with a job like Software Engineering, that‚Äôs great! It‚Äôs even better if some of your skills align with the job, like an aptitude for computers, programming experience, and analytical proficiency.</p>

<p>Tech jobs are in very high demand, meaning you‚Äôll posses <em>rare and valuable skills</em> that will often translate to job security and financial rewards.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a huge shortage in computer science talent, which places a premium on these skills. For me, wearing a hoodie to work, or even working from my bedroom, are pretty much the best perks on the planet. Don‚Äôt even get me started on free food üòù</p>

<p>Even if you do major in Computer Science, college won‚Äôt teach you everything you need to know. You need to be always learning and growing, even after you start your first ‚Äòreal‚Äô job.</p>
