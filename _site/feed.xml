        <title>Switching From iPad to iPad¬†Pro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been using an iPad for about 3 years, and I absolutely love it. Too often I hear tech-enthusiasts blast it as an underpowered toy computer for grandmothers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand &lt;em&gt;wow&lt;/em&gt; is that underselling it. For the most part, I‚Äôve used my iPad as a leisure device. Since most of my work and education is done on a computer, it‚Äôs nice to feel a little separation when I want to unwind with something digital. The more I used it though, the more likely I was to reach for my iPad for professional tasks. When my college went 100% online back in March, it became a precious part of my workflow. Since I almost use my iPad more than my computer (except on workdays.. 8 hours of screen time is plenty), I made the jump over to the iPad pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, there aren‚Äôt dozens of selling points to go with an iPad pro over the regular iPad, especially since the base iPad now supports Apple Pencil. But I‚Äôm still glad I did it! There are however inarguable improvements that make the iPad Pro a joy to own and use for leisure, work, and school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;apple-pencil-2&quot;&gt;Apple Pencil 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apple Pencil 2 is no doubt better than the original. For some reason, the base iPad is only comparable with the original Apple Pencil. They really listened to every complaint about their first generation pencil and solved pretty much all of them. For starters, this generation of the pencil magnetically attaches to the side of the iPad Pro for super convenient storage and &lt;strong&gt;charging&lt;/strong&gt;! Beyond that, the pencil is no longer &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; round. Since it sports one flat edge, the pencil is less prone to roll off the table onto the floor. You make think that‚Äôs a minor issue, but I can testify that my Apple Pencil 1 would roll onto the floor during a lecture at least a few times a week. In the ‚Äúreal‚Äù pencil world, you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find one that is completely round. Lastly, the pencil has a touch sensor, which apps can customize to allow actions (like tool switching) with just a tap on the side of the pencil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;usb-c&quot;&gt;USB-C&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This right here&lt;/em&gt; is a crowd favorite. The original iPad (and every iPhone to date) charges with Apple‚Äôs proprietary ‚ÄúLightning‚Äù connector. The iPad Pro on the other hand uses the ubiquitous ‚ÄúUSB-C‚Äù connector that‚Äôs become popular on smartphones, computers (including MacBooks), and tablets around the world. Again, a very small but welcome improvement. If you‚Äôre wondering why it matters, I can now leave the house with my iPad and MacBook, and &lt;em&gt;1 cord to charge them both&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;screen-size&quot;&gt;Screen Size&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screen size and lack of bezel is the first thing you‚Äôll notice if you put an iPad and a Pro next to each other. The iPad I switched from was a 10.2 inch, while the iPad Pro I switched to is an 11 inch. This doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot of difference on paper, but the trimmed bezel makes it feel like a whole different class of device. Combine this with the square edges (as opposed to rounded on the base iPad), and it‚Äôs easy to see the iPad Pro in a class of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;display-quality&quot;&gt;Display Quality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base level iPad sports 264 pixels per inch with 500 nits brightness. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro boasts 264 pixels per inch with 600 nits of brightness. The Pro‚Äôs display also comes with a fully laminated display with anti-reflective coating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in less technical terms, the two iPads have the same resolution, but the Pro comes with an optionally brighter display that is also laminated and reduces glare. The difference here is marginal, but it‚Äôs definitely noticeable and worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stereo-speakers&quot;&gt;Stereo Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually had no idea of this until I was watching Netflix on the iPad Pro one evening. The base level iPad has some speakers on one end of it, and they‚Äôre nothing to write home about. (the reader may note that here I am, writing about it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). On the other hand, the Pro comes with 4 speakers. When holding it in landscape mode, there are &lt;em&gt;2 speakers on each side of the device.&lt;/em&gt; I can‚Äôt imagine taking much advantage of this serendipitous stereo discovery, but it‚Äôs another subtle difference that separates this iPad into its own class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;face-id&quot;&gt;Face ID&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base level iPad comes with Touch ID, a fingerprint sensor used to unlock the iPad and authenticate for various transactions. But much like newer iPhones, the iPad Pro comes with Face ID, which lets you authenticate by just looking at the iPad. Am I lazy for loving this? Maybe, but it certainly makes using a password manager the easiest thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lidar&quot;&gt;LiDAR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one really knows why LiDAR was included in this years revision of the iPad Pro, but no one is complaining. LiDAR is an additional sensor that acts like radar but uses lasers. Already, this enables the device to deliver next-generation augmented reality experiences. Not many apps take advantage of this yet, but consider this a future-proofing hardware enhancement. Already, apps like Ikea let you see how furniture would look in your house. While this experience is delivered on most iOS devices, the LiDAR sensor makes them darn close to flawless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPad Pro definitely deserves it‚Äôs ‚ÄúPro‚Äù name, even if it‚Äôs not obvious at first glance. All of these subtle improvements over the base model really pull together for a best-in-class experience. I definitely won‚Äôt tell you which iPad to buy, but I‚Äôm super happy with the Pro üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Switching To The Brave¬†Browser</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been using Chrome since around its release, but ditched it last year over privacy concerns. Google has a really big interest in having its eye on everything you do online so it can find a way to profit off of it, which was a little frustrating for me. After some experimenting, I ended up on Safari, which touted some pretty sweet privacy features, mostly in the area of blocking website‚Äôs attempts to follow you across the web. This worked out for a while, but I ended up having to keep Chrome installed, because &lt;em&gt;a shockingly high amount of websites only bother checking to make sure things work in Chrome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole experience of trying to avoid Chrome has definitely been frustrating, but I‚Äôve stuck to it mostly out of spite. A month or so ago, I discovered Brave, and have been loving it. It works and feels like Chrome, but protects your privacy like Firefox or Safari. Beyond that, it even has some decent ad-blocking features and an interesting method for ensuring creators continue to get paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should at least check it out, so here‚Äôs a few highlights to make it easier on you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chromium&quot;&gt;Chromium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromium is a free, open source browser from Google itself üò±&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chromium shouldn‚Äôt be confused with Chrome, which is one of Google‚Äôs most impressive pieces of spyware. Chromium is a bare-bones web browser that &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; can expand upon. Google uses Chromium as the basis for Chrome, and Brave uses Chromium as the basis for itself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing the engine with Chromium provides a ton of benefits. Let‚Äôs be honest‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämost of the world uses Chrome as it‚Äôs default browser. It‚Äôs gone so far as to become a meme that Safari/Edge are only used to install Chrome and then never touched again. The downside to this is that people who build websites, tend to make them work best on Chrome. I‚Äôve had plenty of problems with websites in Safari, including Youtube and Netflix üòí&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Brave is built on the same skeleton that Chrome is, &lt;strong&gt;websites work as if you were using Chrome&lt;/strong&gt;. Even further, &lt;strong&gt;you can use Chrome Extensions!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ad-blocking&quot;&gt;Ad Blocking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad blocking is the thing that brings most people to the Brave browser. Brave blocks harmful ads that try to identify and track you across the internet. Yes you‚Äôll still see ads, but you can expect them to be fewer and further between. When you do see an ad, it is far less likely to be trying to identify you at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want, you can also opt-in to Brave‚Äôs custom ads. The company recognizes that advertisements enable creators to make content for everyone to enjoy, and just making advertisements vanish isn‚Äôt fair to everyone. You can choose to see occasional ads served up by the browser itself, and they will distribute a portion of the earnings from those advertisements to participating creators across the web. So if you spend all your time reading the New York Times, the idea is for that site to get all of the revenue generated by the advertisements you see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tracker-blocking&quot;&gt;Tracker Blocking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond ad-blocking, Brave also blocks many attempts by websites to identify and exploit you. It starts by blocking fingerprinting techniques, which is where a website will collect as much information about you as possible, that it can identify your return visits even if you delete cookies and use a VPN. Brave goes one step further and stops cross-site cookies, which are yet another attempt for a website to observe your behavior &lt;em&gt;after you leave the website&lt;/em&gt; üòí&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-browsing-with-tor&quot;&gt;Private Browsing With Tor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want, Brave will let you browse using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29&quot;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;, which is an open-source system for anonymous communication. In short, it works by routing requests through multiple servers and encrypting it each step of the way. Today it is maintained by its own non-profit, which states the following about it‚Äôs use -&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We, at the Tor Project, fight every day for everyone to have private access to an uncensored internet, and Tor has become the world‚Äôs strongest tool for privacy and freedom online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, all that to say, Brave‚Äôs private browsing is a whole lot more private than Chrome‚Äôs ‚Äúprivate‚Äù browsing. I‚Äôve not actually used this feature though, as routing things through Tor slows your experience substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;brave-is-a-browser-that-feels-and-acts-a-lot-like-chrome-but-lets-you-step-outside-the-google-ecosystem-and-retake-control-over-some-of-your-digital-footprint&quot;&gt;Brave is a browser that feels and acts a lot like Chrome, but lets you step outside the Google ecosystem and retake control over some of your digital footprint.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        <title>My Favorite Productivity Tips</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If a craftsman wants to do good work, he must first sharpen his tools.‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäConfucius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In math words, productivity typically is units of output per unit of time. Talking about our own work that way makes us feel like machines, and is a bit too reductionist. When I think of productivity, I think about getting done what I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to get done in time so that I can do what I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to get done. However you define it, productivity matters to you whether you‚Äôre a student, knowledge worker, parent, landscaper, or anything in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;em&gt;freelancer&lt;/em&gt;, increasing my productivity has allowed me to increase the amount of money I can make per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;em&gt;student&lt;/em&gt;, focusing on productivity ensures that I stay on top of my coursework while still enjoying the meaningful things in life, like walks in the woods with my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I‚Äôve compiled a list of my favorite productivity tips that I‚Äôve discovered in the last few years, and I hope you find them as helpful as I have.‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;daily-highlight-&quot;&gt;Daily Highlight üîç&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is concept is pretty new to me, and it comes from the book ‚ÄúMake Time‚Äù by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. They advocate for picking a single priority for the day and putting as much energy as possible into it. As someone who typically makes obsessively detailed lists for my days, this is a little bit odd to me‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSo of course I tried it out for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QR8pokk11W5EEBI0jOzgGA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Reading ‚ÄúMake Time‚Äù with a view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book (which I cannot recommend enough), the authors explain that todo lists aren‚Äôt focused enough, and long term goals are too hard to measure progress towards. Whenever you sit down to do work, whatever that looks like for your occupation, you should &lt;strong&gt;write down the one thing that matters most to you for the time you‚Äôre about to spend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been doing this for about 2 weeks now, and it‚Äôs helped me in a few different ways. For one, it keeps me honest and focused on what matters most. I‚Äôm far less likely to get sucked into reading documentation when I know my highlight for the day is to ‚ÄúFinish Writing New Tests‚Äù. But beyond that, &lt;em&gt;it gives me greater satisfaction as I stop working for the day.&lt;/em&gt; Even if I miss some other todo items, it‚Äôs remarkably rewarding to set out what I accomplish to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend setting a highlight at the beginning of your work/school times. If the concept interests you more, then you‚Äôd enjoy the book! &lt;em&gt;They don‚Äôt give me anything for saying that&lt;/em&gt; ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deep-work-&quot;&gt;Deep Work ü§´&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport (there‚Äôs that name again ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) says ‚ÄòDeep work‚Äô is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. He has a lot of things to say on the subject, so much so that he wrote a whole book about it. In the aptly titled ‚ÄúDeep Work‚Äù he argues that our constantly distracting digital tools stop us from getting meaningful work done in normal quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the idea is that you do your best work when you‚Äôre completely focused on one thing for an extended period of time. If you say, need to write a 5 page paper, that‚Äôs deep work. Checking your email however, is ‚Äúshallow work.‚Äù In the past, I‚Äôve broken down tasks like writing a 5 page paper into small intervals to make it manageable, but this often leads to lost time and a lower quality product, as your brain is spending too much time going in and out of the deep work ‚Äúzone.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to approach something with deep work, is to schedule some time for it, a process called ‚Äútime blocking,‚Äù and then focus on that thing, eliminating distractions like notifications or meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a pretty cool startup called Clockwise that produces a tool that will automatically rearrange your meetings (and subsequently, your colleague‚Äôs calendars) to allow you as large of a contiguous block of free time as possible to get deep work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs my favorite blog post that explains more on deep work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doist.com/blog/deep-work/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Work: The Complete Guide (Including a Step-by-Step Checklist)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pomodoro-&quot;&gt;Pomodoro ‚è∞&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pomodoro is my go-to strategy for getting myself moving when I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don‚Äôt want to. Inertia extends beyond a force of nature and into our professional lives. If we‚Äôre already really productive, it tends to be nice and easy to do the next task. If we‚Äôve been slugging around for a while, it can become incredibly hard just to get moving on that first thing. However, once most people get started, they find that getting past that initial friction is all they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pomodoro relies on the inertia rule of productivity to get things done in short intervals with breaks as a reward system. The idea is you set a work timer, typically for 25 minutes, and focus on one task for the entire period. Then, you take a 5 minute break to be a sloth again and repeat as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work for 25 minutes, take a five minute break.&lt;/strong&gt; If you do this twice, you will have accomplished 50 minutes of high quality work in just 1 hour, which is a win no matter how you look at it. This technique conflicts a bit with the philosophy of deep work given it advocates for short time periods, but it does protect your attention while you work, which is an absolute must. Most importantly, it gets you over that initial friction from getting started. It‚Äôs really hard to convince yourself to study for 4 hours, but it‚Äôs really easy to convince yourself to study for 25 minutes ü§î&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;regular-sleep-&quot;&gt;Regular Sleep üò¥&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep can make you more productive. It always seems like sleep can be a waste of time, right? I mean, to sleep 8 hours a night, we spend 1/3rd of our life &lt;em&gt;unconscious&lt;/em&gt;. How can that be productive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of sleep that way is a bit too reductionist. While we sleep, our brain does the necessary work to decompress, rest, and shift things from short term to long term storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the negative effects on your well-being, if you don‚Äôt sleep enough, or you sleep inconsistently, you will surely suffer professionally. I‚Äôve found that sleeping 7‚Äì8 hours a night, every night, helps me to feel focused and healthy, freeing me to do my best work and enjoy life without having to make too many sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt look at sleep as a waste of time, but look at it as the best way to take care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;task-management-&quot;&gt;Task Management üë®‚Äçüî¨&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entire books have been written about task management, and dozens of applications are out there to help refine it. &lt;strong&gt;The single greatest benefit of keeping things you want and need to do in a written or digital system is the bandwidth it frees up in your mind&lt;/strong&gt;. Whenever a thought pops into my head, something like ‚ÄúGet a mothers day card for mom‚Äù, I throw it into my task app and my mind is free to resume doing real work. It seems tiny, but the pressure of trying to remember your responsibilities, no matter how large, can cost you &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any approach to keeping your tasks under control is better than no approach, but I tend to go as organized as possible. I prefer apps over paper, so that I can always access it, and it‚Äôs easy to move things around. Specifically, I use Todoist, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeffmorhous.com/how-i-use-todoist-to-organize-my-life-as-a-student/&quot;&gt;which I‚Äôve written a whole article about.&lt;/a&gt; I throw things into the app as they come into my head, and at the beginning of every week I refine things to make sure each day is manageable in workload. I use the priorities feature to single out my highlight, a nod to my newest tip above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a todo app wouldn‚Äôt help you with your &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt;, it will help you with your &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to be known as dependable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unplug-&quot;&gt;Unplug üîå&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one seems obvious to me. Our minds are constantly stimulated, a condition that we‚Äôve only faced for the last few decades. In his book, ‚ÄúDigital Minimalism,‚Äù Cal Newport advocates for a simple life free of constant digital distraction. Now, you don‚Äôt have to take all his advice, but a big takeaway is the &lt;strong&gt;mental benefit you receive from doing something outside of screens&lt;/strong&gt;, especially if all your work is done on a screen. This means, after a long day at the computer, watching TV isn‚Äôt necessarily the best option for your noggin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things like going on a walk, cooking, and investing in meaningful relationships all pay huge dividends on your productivity. We‚Äôre not built to work all the time, so if you let your work or low-quality leisure consume your life, you‚Äôll find yourself struggling to compete with (and less happy than) your peers who take time to unplug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the thought of unplugging makes you nervous, it‚Äôs a good sign your brain needs that break even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-&quot;&gt;Reading üìñ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading gives you superpowers, simple as that. If you make reading a regular habit, your attention span will increase and strengthen, alongside your rapidly growing reading speed. Beyond that, you also absorb information from whatever you happen to be reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plenty of successful people make reading a priority in their life. Warren Buffet is known to spend 5‚Äì6 hours a day reading, while Bill Gates is known to pour through 50 books a year. When asked about his reading, Buffet said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúRead 500 pages like this every day. That‚Äôs how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading is a wonderfully relaxing and rewarding hobby that will push you towards success faster than any other.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Give Your ViewController An Activity Indicator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;UIKit provides a nifty little spinning wheel we can display to the user when we‚Äôre waiting on something that the user can‚Äôt see. It‚Äôs considered a best practice to pop one of these up when doing something like a network call, so the person using our app isn‚Äôt clueless as to what‚Äôs going on. Basically, you create the spinner, and add it to your view. Then, just before a background task like an API request, tell it to animate. When the background request finishes, you just tell it to stop animating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, declare your spinner in the ViewController&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;var activityIndicator = UIActivityIndicatorView(style: .Large)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside viewDidLoad, or a method called by viewDidLoad, add the spinner to your view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;activityIndicator.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
view.addSubview(activityIndicator)
activityIndicator.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor).isActive = true
activityIndicator.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor).isActive = **true**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you make your background task, start the spinner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;activityIndicator.startAnimating()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And when the background task completes, stop the spinner!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;self.activityIndicator.stopAnimating()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is such a small UI feature that has a huge benefit. If you implement it correctly, the people that use your app will probably never consciously notice it. But if you don‚Äôt implement this, users will likely feel like your app is slow, or mistake a normal wait time for a buggy freeze of the app. Hope you got some value out of this, I know your users will!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Customize UITextView</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So recently I‚Äôve been working on an iOS version of my Mock My Words app. It‚Äôs pretty simple in functionality so I wanted to compensate with a nice user interface. The main functionality requires that a user enter (or paste) in text of pretty much any size. Oftentimes iOS text entry with a  &lt;strong&gt;UITextField&lt;/strong&gt;, but that only offers single line input. For multi-line input, you have to use  &lt;strong&gt;UITextView&lt;/strong&gt;  üòî. After throwing that in my app I was rather unimpressed with how it looked. So, I decided to put my own spin on it. It took a bit of research and I‚Äôm pleased with how it turned out so I thought I‚Äôd share with the community on how customize the UITextView object to your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-the-uitextview&quot;&gt;Create the UITextView&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm building this app programmatically, so the first step is to instantiate the UITextView object. If you‚Äôre using a storyboard, you‚Äôll want to create an IBOutlet and then follow the other steps the same. I declared my UITextView at the class level of the view controller it‚Äôs used in, and the one-line looks like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    **let** textBox = UITextView()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note, all of the following code should be executed by  &lt;em&gt;viewdidload()&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but feel free to extract it to a function and then call that function from viewDidLoad()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;add-it-to-the-view&quot;&gt;Add it to the view&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you have to add it to the view hierarchy so it actually shows up. If you‚Äôre using a storyboard, skip this step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    view.addSubview(textBox)textBox.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = **false**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-the-delegate&quot;&gt;Set the delegate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you actually want your app to react to actions the user may take, you need to make your view controller extend UITextViewDelegate, and then have the following line in your configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    textBox.delegate = **self**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;customize-the-textbox&quot;&gt;Customize the textbox&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use creative freedom here, but here‚Äôs how I laid out my textbox view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
5
6
7
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    textBox.autocorrectionType = .no
    textBox.text = placeholderText
    textBox.backgroundColor = .secondarySystemBackground
    textBox.textColor = .secondaryLabel
    textBox.font = UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .body)
    textBox.layer.cornerRadius = 20
    textBox.textContainerInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: 10, left: 10, bottom: 10, right: 10)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-it-a-shadow&quot;&gt;Give it a shadow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this is optional, but this is how I gave my textbox a shadow so it has a material design feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
5
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    textBox.layer.shadowColor = UIColor.gray.cgColor;
    textBox.layer.shadowOffset = CGSize(width: 0.75, height: 0.75)
    textBox.layer.shadowOpacity = 0.4
    textBox.layer.shadowRadius = 20
    textBox.layer.masksToBounds = **false**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-your-view-where-to-put-it&quot;&gt;Tell your view where to put it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your method for doing this will definitely vary, but I used&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    NSLayoutConstraint.activate([insert your array of constraints here])
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that‚Äôs it! You have a custom textbox that kind of floats above the view you put it in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Set Up Programmatic Interfaces in iOS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of valid reasons to use storyboards or to programmatically lay out your interface. Storyboards let us quickly build out a beautiful interface, but face limitations and scale problems. If you have a team working on an app, then Storyboards can get messy and hard to keep track of with version control. Once you decide that storyboards aren‚Äôt the tool for you, Xcode takes some tinkering to set things up to lay out your interface in Swift. After you create your project,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First,  &lt;strong&gt;delete&lt;/strong&gt;  the  &lt;em&gt;Main.storyboard.&lt;/em&gt; Yup, delete it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we have to delete any reference to it- The first spot we need to take care of is the reference to  &lt;em&gt;Main.storyboard&lt;/em&gt;  in  &lt;em&gt;Info.plist&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äî Go ahead and  &lt;strong&gt;delete the entry by clicking the minus sign&lt;/strong&gt;. The last place it‚Äôs referenced is in the  &lt;em&gt;Deployment Info&lt;/em&gt; section of your project settings. A dropdown for  &lt;em&gt;Main Interface&lt;/em&gt;  will still say Main.storyboard,  &lt;strong&gt;Select the empty option in the dropdown&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, add the following to your SceneDelegate.swift&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }
window = UIWindow(frame: windowScene.coordinateSpace.bounds)
window?.windowScene = windowScene
window?.rootViewController = ViewController()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can specify your actual layout in ViewController.swift!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôre all set up to implement the design of your dreams programmatically, and  &lt;a href=&quot;https://softauthor.com/ios-ui-design-programmatically-xcode-9-swift-4&quot;&gt;here‚Äôs a quick reference to help you get the hang of it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Wirelessly Test Your App on Your iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A good thing to note is that the mac you are using Xcode on and the iPhone (or iPad) you want to test on  &lt;strong&gt;must be on the same network&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to the build button, go to select a device/simulator. Here, mine just says ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Generic iOS Device&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2284/1*4iGsUqTlI2w8rJ5ILnOBOw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you click on it, select ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Add Additional Simulators&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù The result will be a modal that looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3204/1*f5VkFuTfSE0pNmhsdPXmAA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and switch over to devices. Plug your device in and unlock it, and it should appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and click the checkbox that says ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Connect via network&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù and voila!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have to restart Xcode, but you should now be able to run your apps on your device without physically connecting it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty small trick but it may save you tons of time, and honestly it‚Äôs just too cool not to set up. Hope this helped, and if you ran in to trouble, let me know below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Switching From Android To iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used Android since roughly 2011, and would definitely classify myself as a fanboy. Now that I do quite a bit of iOS development for work, I finally made the jump over to using an iPhone full-time. Now that I‚Äôve switched, I don‚Äôt know if I could ever go back. It‚Äôs not like I was completely oblivious to the iPhone before I switched ‚Äî I‚Äôve even been using an iPad for years and making iOS apps for quite some time. I‚Äôve just been too reluctant to switch because I was so comfortable with my Android phone. In fact, the Galaxy S10e came out after the iPhone XR, so the iPhone XR is actually an older device! So what is it that makes me so pumped to now have an iPhone as my daily driver? ü§î&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;big-name-apps-work-better&quot;&gt;Big-name apps work better&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple definitely has a majority market share of smartphones in the US. So that means, companies with a focus on the United States have an incentive to put more resources into their iOS apps, as opposed to Android. I‚Äôve always known this and been kind of annoyed as an Android user. Now that I‚Äôm using an iPhone, I‚Äôm starting to really appreciate it ü§©&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of apps look and act exactly the same on both platforms, and hats off to those companies. However, a lot of smaller things come to the iPhone first, and their iPhone apps often end up being more polished than their Android counterparts. Shockingly enough, this is the most evident in banking/finance apps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;things-just-work-like-magic&quot;&gt;Things just work like magic&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android‚Äôs open ecosystem is incredibly open and customizable. I‚Äôve always loved this, and its one of the reasons I have stuck with it so long. However, this often results in manufactures or carriers making unnecessary changes to the OS for their own benefit (looking at you, Samsung). The Android software is built to fit an enormous range of hardware, and it‚Äôs begun to feel like a one-size-fits-none situation. Once I stopped being able to articulate what I specifically liked about Android over the iPhone, I decided to make the switch at least temporarily. I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the consistency of experience that Apple has provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating software with hardware in mind, and vice versa has clearly evident benefits. I‚Äôve been using the iPhone for a little over a week now, and haven‚Äôt experienced any crashes or even lag. Even FaceID works 100 times more consistently than its Android counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-emphasis-on-design-is-notable&quot;&gt;The emphasis on design is notable&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm an engineer, so design isn‚Äôt exactly my strong suit.  I used to not even care about design, but the more I use computers and phones in my life, the more I want to actually &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; the experience.  This is especially magnified as I dive into a profession driven by creating positive software experiences for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs become pretty apparent that Android is  &lt;em&gt;engineered and then designed&lt;/em&gt;, while iOS is  &lt;em&gt;designed and then engineered.&lt;/em&gt; Color schemes, animation, and even sounds have surprised me with the level of detail invested. iMessage is without a doubt the most obvious example of this, specifically with the whole screen effect features ü§Ø&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Emoji is just better. I used to never use emoji. Then I started using them on my mac because my girlfriend pointed out how much  &lt;em&gt;better they appeared&lt;/em&gt; than any other implementation I‚Äôve seen. Emoji are supposed to communicate something better than text, and Apple really nails the fun element here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;syncing-with-my-macbook-is-too-convenient&quot;&gt;Syncing with my MacBook is too convenient&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having iMessage on both my phone and my MacBook is a pretty novel feature. Not incredibly useful but definitely nice to be able to respond to texts in the middle of using my Computer without having switch devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airdropping between my phone and computer has been pretty great too! Being able to transfer documents, pictures, and even links back and forth without emailing them is a bit of a time saver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just today, I got sent a link to a site that looked like garbage on mobile. All I had to do was open safari and click on the tab (from my MacBook) that was open on my iPhone, and ba-bam, I was in business on my MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the syncing is definitely not perfect. There‚Äôs a bit of a lag between my phone and computer, and I‚Äôve often had my computer be ringing after I already answered a call on my phone. But still, the sync between the 2 is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;privacy-&quot;&gt;Privacy üîê&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll be honest, Apple‚Äôs stance on encryption is bold and attractive to me as a consumer. They‚Äôve shown in public that they‚Äôre willing to stand up to even the government to protect their users‚Äô information, and that‚Äôs priceless in a time where the economy runs on personal information. If you use an Android phone, you‚Äôre all but consenting to have Google track everything about you. A great side effect of shifting to the iPhone is the option for more choice over disclosure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the switch from Android to the iPhone was a lot like my jump from Windows to Mac. It took me years to work up the guts but I‚Äôm definitely not regretting it. Yes, Apple charges significantly more for products that compare equally on a technical level. The ‚ÄúApple Tax‚Äù is very real, and a barrier for many. If you‚Äôre trying to decide if that price jump is worth it for you, talk to some friends, and ask them what they like about their iPhone! Go into the Apple store and get hands-on with them üë®‚Äçüî¨&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Handle College at Home</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you one of the tens of thousands of college students who‚Äôve been displaced recently? Lots of people are talking, writing, and reading about their transmission to  &lt;em&gt;remote work&lt;/em&gt;, but not much has been said about  &lt;em&gt;remote learning.&lt;/em&gt; A lot of the same concepts apply, but a lot differs! I was actually homeschooled for 12 years, which involved some online classes, and a lot of self-direction. In college, I‚Äôve already taken a few online classes. Even my job has been remote for quite some time, and now (like you, I‚Äôm assuming) I‚Äôm forced to finish out my entire academic semester online as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not super worried about the transition, solely because it doesn‚Äôt change my lifestyle all too much. There‚Äôs still some adjustment, mostly being back home and coordinating with my parents, one of which is also WFH (working from home) in this tense time. Being left to your own devices AND being locked in your house requires a ton of self-discipline, and can definitely get to you really fast. Everyone is different, but there are some things that I know help me to be as productive and healthy as I can when working remotely. Here are some tips that I hope help you be as successful as you can. Build strong habits early, and you‚Äôll be thanking yourself when online exams roll around the corner ü•¥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;recognize-the-situation&quot;&gt;Recognize the situation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2190/1*ex2Pfy4eGyvrhiaOqEEQ4Q.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs no doubt the world is hurting right now. You‚Äôre not alone. People everywhere are having their lives turned upside down. Remember, the world is not ending, but the steps we‚Äôre taking are indeed stopping it from ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve all had the rug pulled out from under us. Your professors and peers are all in the same boat as you. We didn‚Äôt sign up for this (well some did, but if you signed up for online classes to begin with you probably could write this article). Be patient with your faculty as they work to deliver you the education that you paid for. Be patient with yourself ‚Äî it would be really unusual to be at your peak productivity during a time of worldwide crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;create-a-space-for-school&quot;&gt;Create a space for school&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, watching lectures in bed and studying on the couch is sick and all(no pun intended), but it‚Äôs going to lead to devastating productivity losses. Some people can thrive wherever, but as we spend more and more time in our homes &lt;em&gt;a-la quarantine,&lt;/em&gt; it becomes increasingly important to remind your mind where work does and doesn‚Äôt happen. I work best in a closed room with a clean desk and an nice chair. But that‚Äôs not going to be possible for everyone all the time. Not everyone has a desk, I‚Äôm posted up at my parents kitchen table üëå. Just try your best to dedicate some physical space to your education, as it will certainly help you dedicate some mental space. Music and headphones are your friends for isolation, as it will help your drown out others sharing your school space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;create-a-time-for-school&quot;&gt;Create a time for school&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1212/1*umY_kJeLIXFkxDttK5iwyw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúspring break forever,‚Äù though it still feels like that. It‚Äôs really important that you dedicate time during your day to ‚Äúlectures‚Äù in whatever form they‚Äôll take, in addition to the obligatory studying and homework. Turn off your phone, shut the door if you can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dedicating time to school will help you strike a healthy work-life balance. There‚Äôs no such thing as just leaving the tv on ‚Äòin the background‚Äô while you do practice exams. If you put your focus on school during the time you promised yourself you‚Äôd be doing it, your free time will be yours to spend entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;use-a-planner&quot;&gt;Use a planner&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of online classes is stupid hard. Professors may or may not remind you of things that are due, and it‚Äôs certainly not their responsibility to keep you organized. Write everything down and prioritize your days. A lot of people find it easiest to do this digitally ‚Äî I use Todoist,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/swlh/how-i-use-todoist-to-organize-my-life-as-a-student-8c95d5597a1d?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=5cdc006415567f1db52f83684016fe1a&quot;&gt;and I already wrote a piece about how it helps me stay organized.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;communicate-with-your-family&quot;&gt;Communicate with your family&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre at home for the long haul like me, this is going to take some adjusting for everyone. Be clear with them that you need undisturbed time to dedicate to your studies in order to succeed. It‚Äôs crazy hard to get deep work done if you‚Äôre constantly being interrupted, even if the interruptions are important. If you attention is absolutely need during your school time, help you family understand how to get that message across while still respecting your headspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;get-dressed&quot;&gt;Get Dressed&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs easy to just lounge around in pajamas all day, and that‚Äôs totally fine. However, if you get up and get ready for the day like you were going to be out and about, it helps remind your mind that this isn‚Äôt a snow day. Hygiene and lifestyle habits will do wonders for your mental health!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these tips not withstanding, remote work gives you the freedom to break these rules when needed. Use this wild pandemic to take advantage of the autonomy remote work offers. Who knows, you may discover that your top job desire is the opportunity for remote work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How I Bombed a Microsoft Interview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôve actually interviewed with Microsoft a couple of times. The first time I interviewed for a Software Engineering Internship, it was with a Microsoft engineer on my college campus. It was a great time, super challenging, and also terrifying. We talked very technically ‚Äî it was your classic whiteboard interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was handed a piece of blank paper and asked to write code that performed a specific operation (can‚Äôt go into too much detail ü§´) on a binary search tree. The question was well beyond my skillset at the time, and I felt like I was drowning in sweat. After talking with the interview to clarify constraints, I walked him through the problem in several example graphs. This helped me approach my algorithmic solution, which I wrapped up with just minutes to spare. I was told that my feedback could be used for up to a year, so when recruiting opened up for the year, I would likely be pushed on to the next round (which for Microsoft, I believe is an on-site).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next several months, I studied like it was my job to ensure I wouldn‚Äôt be sweating through my shirt when I got the opportunity to interview again. I spent quality time with everyone‚Äôs favorite resources ‚Äî Cracking The Coding Interview and Leetcode. I spent all of my preparation time preparing for questions like the one I had received that initial interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-then-my-recruiter-left-microsoft-&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But then my recruiter left Microsoft üò¨&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was told by the new area recruiter that I‚Äôd have to submit my application and begin again. YIKES. Although I was bummed, it wasn‚Äôt the end of the world, and I applied again! I actually went a month or two without a reply, until I got ahold of someone internally who gave the new recruiter for my area a nudge. No hate on these recruiters though, their job is very challenging and I don‚Äôt envy the sheer amount of candidates they‚Äôre responsible for. Anyways, I was eventually contacted to schedule an initial phone screen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prepared for this just like I had been all summer, leetcoding like it was my job. So you may not be surprised that this phone screen was not at all what I was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phone screen was  &lt;em&gt;not very technical.&lt;/em&gt;  It seemed like an initial get-to-know-you style call, to see if I was a real human being who could hold a conversation.  &lt;em&gt;Usually&lt;/em&gt;, I‚Äôm alright at that. But I was so caught off guard by the contrast of this to my first interview that  &lt;strong&gt;I choked, and I choked hard&lt;/strong&gt;. During that phone call, I was not a real human being who could hold a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately, he asked me the first question,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why do you want to work at Microsoft?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, my last interview didn‚Äôt care what I thought about Microsoft??? He just wanted to see how comfortable I was with data structures! I wasn‚Äôt even kind of ready! This question is so fundamental to a job interview, I‚Äôm embarresed just thinking about how I struggled to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I  &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt;  I wanted to work at Microsoft, but at that time, I couldn‚Äôt articulate why. Then next question came ‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs your favorite Microsoft product, and what would you change about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sweating. I switched to Mac a few years ago, how did he know? üò©Thankfully I remembered that my IDE of choice, VS Code, is a Microsoft product! I love it and happily described how perfect it was. So needless to say I wasn‚Äôt prepared for him to ask ‚Äúwhat I wanted to change about VS Code‚Äù. Change? I loved it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I was really hoping that he would throw me a question that would allow me to show off my practiced binary tree knowledge. But yet again, another curveball was thrown my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tell me about a project where you used a data structure and algorithm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üò© I‚Äôve done plenty of  &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; personal projects and plenty interview-style questions involving data structures and algorithms ‚Äî but it immediately dawned on me that I never combined these two. My theoretical knowledge of algorithmic concepts was definitely siloed into the domain of interviewing. I struggled to describe how I used basic array sorts to populate iOS tableviews, and this definitely didn‚Äôt thrill my interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest mistake I made in this whole process&lt;/strong&gt;  was making a blanket assumption my ‚Äúphone screen‚Äù would be exactly like my previous interview that Spring. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for a question as straightforward as ‚ÄúWhy do you want to work here‚Äù!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt over-prepare, I prepared for the wrong thing entirely. I assumed that I only had 1 area to improve in, and was proven sorely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have hired me after that call either. But this article isn‚Äôt a pity party for myself. It‚Äôs a reflection of what caused me to present myself so poorly. Yes, I failed this interview (with flying colors üôÉ). But you can be assured that I won‚Äôt make that mistake again. Never again will I sit down for an interview (or even an info meeting) without internalizing my thoughts about the company and how I would contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúSuccess is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.‚Äù&lt;br /&gt;
‚Äï  &lt;strong&gt;Winston S. Churchill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
