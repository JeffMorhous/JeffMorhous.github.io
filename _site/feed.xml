        <title>How To Customize UITextView</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So recently I’ve been working on an iOS version of my Mock My Words app. It’s pretty simple in functionality so I wanted to compensate with a nice user interface. The main functionality requires that a user enter (or paste) in text of pretty much any size. Oftentimes iOS text entry with a  &lt;strong&gt;UITextField&lt;/strong&gt;, but that only offers single line input. For multi-line input, you have to use  &lt;strong&gt;UITextView&lt;/strong&gt;  😔. After throwing that in my app I was rather unimpressed with how it looked. So, I decided to put my own spin on it. It took a bit of research and I’m pleased with how it turned out so I thought I’d share with the community on how customize the UITextView object to your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-the-uitextview&quot;&gt;Create the UITextView&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m building this app programmatically, so the first step is to instantiate the UITextView object. If you’re using a storyboard, you’ll want to create an IBOutlet and then follow the other steps the same. I declared my UITextView at the class level of the view controller it’s used in, and the one-line looks like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    **let** textBox = UITextView()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note, all of the following code should be executed by  &lt;em&gt;viewdidload()&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but feel free to extract it to a function and then call that function from viewDidLoad()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;add-it-to-the-view&quot;&gt;Add it to the view&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you have to add it to the view hierarchy so it actually shows up. If you’re using a storyboard, skip this step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    view.addSubview(textBox)textBox.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = **false**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-the-delegate&quot;&gt;Set the delegate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you actually want your app to react to actions the user may take, you need to make your view controller extend UITextViewDelegate, and then have the following line in your configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    textBox.delegate = **self**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;customize-the-textbox&quot;&gt;Customize the textbox&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use creative freedom here, but here’s how I laid out my textbox view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
5
6
7
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    textBox.autocorrectionType = .no
    textBox.text = placeholderText
    textBox.backgroundColor = .secondarySystemBackground
    textBox.textColor = .secondaryLabel
    textBox.font = UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .body)
    textBox.layer.cornerRadius = 20
    textBox.textContainerInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: 10, left: 10, bottom: 10, right: 10)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-it-a-shadow&quot;&gt;Give it a shadow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this is optional, but this is how I gave my textbox a shadow so it has a material design feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
5
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    textBox.layer.shadowColor = UIColor.gray.cgColor;
    textBox.layer.shadowOffset = CGSize(width: 0.75, height: 0.75)
    textBox.layer.shadowOpacity = 0.4
    textBox.layer.shadowRadius = 20
    textBox.layer.masksToBounds = **false**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-your-view-where-to-put-it&quot;&gt;Tell your view where to put it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your method for doing this will definitely vary, but I used&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    NSLayoutConstraint.activate([insert your array of constraints here])
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it! You have a custom textbox that kind of floats above the view you put it in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Set Up Programmatic Interfaces in iOS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of valid reasons to use storyboards or to programmatically lay out your interface. Storyboards let us quickly build out a beautiful interface, but face limitations and scale problems. If you have a team working on an app, then Storyboards can get messy and hard to keep track of with version control. Once you decide that storyboards aren’t the tool for you, Xcode takes some tinkering to set things up to lay out your interface in Swift. After you create your project,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First,  &lt;strong&gt;delete&lt;/strong&gt;  the  &lt;em&gt;Main.storyboard.&lt;/em&gt; Yup, delete it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we have to delete any reference to it- The first spot we need to take care of is the reference to  &lt;em&gt;Main.storyboard&lt;/em&gt;  in  &lt;em&gt;Info.plist&lt;/em&gt; — Go ahead and  &lt;strong&gt;delete the entry by clicking the minus sign&lt;/strong&gt;. The last place it’s referenced is in the  &lt;em&gt;Deployment Info&lt;/em&gt; section of your project settings. A dropdown for  &lt;em&gt;Main Interface&lt;/em&gt;  will still say Main.storyboard,  &lt;strong&gt;Select the empty option in the dropdown&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, add the following to your SceneDelegate.swift&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }
window = UIWindow(frame: windowScene.coordinateSpace.bounds)
window?.windowScene = windowScene
window?.rootViewController = ViewController()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can specify your actual layout in ViewController.swift!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re all set up to implement the design of your dreams programmatically, and  &lt;a href=&quot;https://softauthor.com/ios-ui-design-programmatically-xcode-9-swift-4&quot;&gt;here’s a quick reference to help you get the hang of it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Wirelessly Test Your App on Your iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A good thing to note is that the mac you are using Xcode on and the iPhone (or iPad) you want to test on  &lt;strong&gt;must be on the same network&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to the build button, go to select a device/simulator. Here, mine just says “&lt;em&gt;Generic iOS Device&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2284/1*4iGsUqTlI2w8rJ5ILnOBOw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you click on it, select “&lt;em&gt;Add Additional Simulators&lt;/em&gt;” The result will be a modal that looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3204/1*f5VkFuTfSE0pNmhsdPXmAA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and switch over to devices. Plug your device in and unlock it, and it should appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and click the checkbox that says “&lt;em&gt;Connect via network&lt;/em&gt;” and voila!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have to restart Xcode, but you should now be able to run your apps on your device without physically connecting it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty small trick but it may save you tons of time, and honestly it’s just too cool not to set up. Hope this helped, and if you ran in to trouble, let me know below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Switching From Android To iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used Android since roughly 2011, and would definitely classify myself as a fanboy. Now that I do quite a bit of iOS development for work, I finally made the jump over to using an iPhone full-time. Now that I’ve switched, I don’t know if I could ever go back. It’s not like I was completely oblivious to the iPhone before I switched — I’ve even been using an iPad for years and making iOS apps for quite some time. I’ve just been too reluctant to switch because I was so comfortable with my Android phone. In fact, the Galaxy S10e came out after the iPhone XR, so the iPhone XR is actually an older device! So what is it that makes me so pumped to now have an iPhone as my daily driver? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;big-name-apps-work-better&quot;&gt;Big-name apps work better&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple definitely has a majority market share of smartphones in the US. So that means, companies with a focus on the United States have an incentive to put more resources into their iOS apps, as opposed to Android. I’ve always known this and been kind of annoyed as an Android user. Now that I’m using an iPhone, I’m starting to really appreciate it 🤩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of apps look and act exactly the same on both platforms, and hats off to those companies. However, a lot of smaller things come to the iPhone first, and their iPhone apps often end up being more polished than their Android counterparts. Shockingly enough, this is the most evident in banking/finance apps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;things-just-work-like-magic&quot;&gt;Things just work like magic&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android’s open ecosystem is incredibly open and customizable. I’ve always loved this, and its one of the reasons I have stuck with it so long. However, this often results in manufactures or carriers making unnecessary changes to the OS for their own benefit (looking at you, Samsung). The Android software is built to fit an enormous range of hardware, and it’s begun to feel like a one-size-fits-none situation. Once I stopped being able to articulate what I specifically liked about Android over the iPhone, I decided to make the switch at least temporarily. I couldn’t be happier with the consistency of experience that Apple has provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating software with hardware in mind, and vice versa has clearly evident benefits. I’ve been using the iPhone for a little over a week now, and haven’t experienced any crashes or even lag. Even FaceID works 100 times more consistently than its Android counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-emphasis-on-design-is-notable&quot;&gt;The emphasis on design is notable&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m an engineer, so design isn’t exactly my strong suit.  I used to not even care about design, but the more I use computers and phones in my life, the more I want to actually &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; the experience.  This is especially magnified as I dive into a profession driven by creating positive software experiences for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s become pretty apparent that Android is  &lt;em&gt;engineered and then designed&lt;/em&gt;, while iOS is  &lt;em&gt;designed and then engineered.&lt;/em&gt; Color schemes, animation, and even sounds have surprised me with the level of detail invested. iMessage is without a doubt the most obvious example of this, specifically with the whole screen effect features 🤯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Emoji is just better. I used to never use emoji. Then I started using them on my mac because my girlfriend pointed out how much  &lt;em&gt;better they appeared&lt;/em&gt; than any other implementation I’ve seen. Emoji are supposed to communicate something better than text, and Apple really nails the fun element here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;syncing-with-my-macbook-is-too-convenient&quot;&gt;Syncing with my MacBook is too convenient&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having iMessage on both my phone and my MacBook is a pretty novel feature. Not incredibly useful but definitely nice to be able to respond to texts in the middle of using my Computer without having switch devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airdropping between my phone and computer has been pretty great too! Being able to transfer documents, pictures, and even links back and forth without emailing them is a bit of a time saver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just today, I got sent a link to a site that looked like garbage on mobile. All I had to do was open safari and click on the tab (from my MacBook) that was open on my iPhone, and ba-bam, I was in business on my MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the syncing is definitely not perfect. There’s a bit of a lag between my phone and computer, and I’ve often had my computer be ringing after I already answered a call on my phone. But still, the sync between the 2 is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;privacy-&quot;&gt;Privacy 🔐&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, Apple’s stance on encryption is bold and attractive to me as a consumer. They’ve shown in public that they’re willing to stand up to even the government to protect their users’ information, and that’s priceless in a time where the economy runs on personal information. If you use an Android phone, you’re all but consenting to have Google track everything about you. A great side effect of shifting to the iPhone is the option for more choice over disclosure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the switch from Android to the iPhone was a lot like my jump from Windows to Mac. It took me years to work up the guts but I’m definitely not regretting it. Yes, Apple charges significantly more for products that compare equally on a technical level. The “Apple Tax” is very real, and a barrier for many. If you’re trying to decide if that price jump is worth it for you, talk to some friends, and ask them what they like about their iPhone! Go into the Apple store and get hands-on with them 👨‍🔬&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Handle College at Home</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you one of the tens of thousands of college students who’ve been displaced recently? Lots of people are talking, writing, and reading about their transmission to  &lt;em&gt;remote work&lt;/em&gt;, but not much has been said about  &lt;em&gt;remote learning.&lt;/em&gt; A lot of the same concepts apply, but a lot differs! I was actually homeschooled for 12 years, which involved some online classes, and a lot of self-direction. In college, I’ve already taken a few online classes. Even my job has been remote for quite some time, and now (like you, I’m assuming) I’m forced to finish out my entire academic semester online as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not super worried about the transition, solely because it doesn’t change my lifestyle all too much. There’s still some adjustment, mostly being back home and coordinating with my parents, one of which is also WFH (working from home) in this tense time. Being left to your own devices AND being locked in your house requires a ton of self-discipline, and can definitely get to you really fast. Everyone is different, but there are some things that I know help me to be as productive and healthy as I can when working remotely. Here are some tips that I hope help you be as successful as you can. Build strong habits early, and you’ll be thanking yourself when online exams roll around the corner 🥴&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;recognize-the-situation&quot;&gt;Recognize the situation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2190/1*ex2Pfy4eGyvrhiaOqEEQ4Q.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt the world is hurting right now. You’re not alone. People everywhere are having their lives turned upside down. Remember, the world is not ending, but the steps we’re taking are indeed stopping it from ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all had the rug pulled out from under us. Your professors and peers are all in the same boat as you. We didn’t sign up for this (well some did, but if you signed up for online classes to begin with you probably could write this article). Be patient with your faculty as they work to deliver you the education that you paid for. Be patient with yourself — it would be really unusual to be at your peak productivity during a time of worldwide crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;create-a-space-for-school&quot;&gt;Create a space for school&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, watching lectures in bed and studying on the couch is sick and all(no pun intended), but it’s going to lead to devastating productivity losses. Some people can thrive wherever, but as we spend more and more time in our homes &lt;em&gt;a-la quarantine,&lt;/em&gt; it becomes increasingly important to remind your mind where work does and doesn’t happen. I work best in a closed room with a clean desk and an nice chair. But that’s not going to be possible for everyone all the time. Not everyone has a desk, I’m posted up at my parents kitchen table 👌. Just try your best to dedicate some physical space to your education, as it will certainly help you dedicate some mental space. Music and headphones are your friends for isolation, as it will help your drown out others sharing your school space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;create-a-time-for-school&quot;&gt;Create a time for school&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1212/1*umY_kJeLIXFkxDttK5iwyw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t “spring break forever,” though it still feels like that. It’s really important that you dedicate time during your day to “lectures” in whatever form they’ll take, in addition to the obligatory studying and homework. Turn off your phone, shut the door if you can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dedicating time to school will help you strike a healthy work-life balance. There’s no such thing as just leaving the tv on ‘in the background’ while you do practice exams. If you put your focus on school during the time you promised yourself you’d be doing it, your free time will be yours to spend entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;use-a-planner&quot;&gt;Use a planner&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of online classes is stupid hard. Professors may or may not remind you of things that are due, and it’s certainly not their responsibility to keep you organized. Write everything down and prioritize your days. A lot of people find it easiest to do this digitally — I use Todoist,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/swlh/how-i-use-todoist-to-organize-my-life-as-a-student-8c95d5597a1d?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=5cdc006415567f1db52f83684016fe1a&quot;&gt;and I already wrote a piece about how it helps me stay organized.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;communicate-with-your-family&quot;&gt;Communicate with your family&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re at home for the long haul like me, this is going to take some adjusting for everyone. Be clear with them that you need undisturbed time to dedicate to your studies in order to succeed. It’s crazy hard to get deep work done if you’re constantly being interrupted, even if the interruptions are important. If you attention is absolutely need during your school time, help you family understand how to get that message across while still respecting your headspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;get-dressed&quot;&gt;Get Dressed&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to just lounge around in pajamas all day, and that’s totally fine. However, if you get up and get ready for the day like you were going to be out and about, it helps remind your mind that this isn’t a snow day. Hygiene and lifestyle habits will do wonders for your mental health!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these tips not withstanding, remote work gives you the freedom to break these rules when needed. Use this wild pandemic to take advantage of the autonomy remote work offers. Who knows, you may discover that your top job desire is the opportunity for remote work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How I Bombed a Microsoft Interview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I’ve actually interviewed with Microsoft a couple of times. The first time I interviewed for a Software Engineering Internship, it was with a Microsoft engineer on my college campus. It was a great time, super challenging, and also terrifying. We talked very technically — it was your classic whiteboard interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was handed a piece of blank paper and asked to write code that performed a specific operation (can’t go into too much detail 🤫) on a binary search tree. The question was well beyond my skillset at the time, and I felt like I was drowning in sweat. After talking with the interview to clarify constraints, I walked him through the problem in several example graphs. This helped me approach my algorithmic solution, which I wrapped up with just minutes to spare. I was told that my feedback could be used for up to a year, so when recruiting opened up for the year, I would likely be pushed on to the next round (which for Microsoft, I believe is an on-site).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next several months, I studied like it was my job to ensure I wouldn’t be sweating through my shirt when I got the opportunity to interview again. I spent quality time with everyone’s favorite resources — Cracking The Coding Interview and Leetcode. I spent all of my preparation time preparing for questions like the one I had received that initial interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-then-my-recruiter-left-microsoft-&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But then my recruiter left Microsoft 😬&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was told by the new area recruiter that I’d have to submit my application and begin again. YIKES. Although I was bummed, it wasn’t the end of the world, and I applied again! I actually went a month or two without a reply, until I got ahold of someone internally who gave the new recruiter for my area a nudge. No hate on these recruiters though, their job is very challenging and I don’t envy the sheer amount of candidates they’re responsible for. Anyways, I was eventually contacted to schedule an initial phone screen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prepared for this just like I had been all summer, leetcoding like it was my job. So you may not be surprised that this phone screen was not at all what I was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phone screen was  &lt;em&gt;not very technical.&lt;/em&gt;  It seemed like an initial get-to-know-you style call, to see if I was a real human being who could hold a conversation.  &lt;em&gt;Usually&lt;/em&gt;, I’m alright at that. But I was so caught off guard by the contrast of this to my first interview that  &lt;strong&gt;I choked, and I choked hard&lt;/strong&gt;. During that phone call, I was not a real human being who could hold a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately, he asked me the first question,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why do you want to work at Microsoft?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, my last interview didn’t care what I thought about Microsoft??? He just wanted to see how comfortable I was with data structures! I wasn’t even kind of ready! This question is so fundamental to a job interview, I’m embarresed just thinking about how I struggled to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I  &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt;  I wanted to work at Microsoft, but at that time, I couldn’t articulate why. Then next question came —&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What’s your favorite Microsoft product, and what would you change about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sweating. I switched to Mac a few years ago, how did he know? 😩Thankfully I remembered that my IDE of choice, VS Code, is a Microsoft product! I love it and happily described how perfect it was. So needless to say I wasn’t prepared for him to ask “what I wanted to change about VS Code”. Change? I loved it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I was really hoping that he would throw me a question that would allow me to show off my practiced binary tree knowledge. But yet again, another curveball was thrown my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tell me about a project where you used a data structure and algorithm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😩 I’ve done plenty of  &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; personal projects and plenty interview-style questions involving data structures and algorithms — but it immediately dawned on me that I never combined these two. My theoretical knowledge of algorithmic concepts was definitely siloed into the domain of interviewing. I struggled to describe how I used basic array sorts to populate iOS tableviews, and this definitely didn’t thrill my interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest mistake I made in this whole process&lt;/strong&gt;  was making a blanket assumption my “phone screen” would be exactly like my previous interview that Spring. I wasn’t prepared for a question as straightforward as “Why do you want to work here”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t over-prepare, I prepared for the wrong thing entirely. I assumed that I only had 1 area to improve in, and was proven sorely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I probably wouldn’t have hired me after that call either. But this article isn’t a pity party for myself. It’s a reflection of what caused me to present myself so poorly. Yes, I failed this interview (with flying colors 🙃). But you can be assured that I won’t make that mistake again. Never again will I sit down for an interview (or even an info meeting) without internalizing my thoughts about the company and how I would contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Interviewing For a Software Engineering Internship at Amazon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Why would I talk about Amazon when I’ve interviewed at more than a dozen companies? Well, it’s one of the most valuable and influential brands on planet earth — and software engineers are lining up at the door for a chance to join the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company boasts stellar compensation, benefits, and the opportunity to work on monumentally impactful code. Because of all this, it’s incredibly challenging to get a full-time role, let alone an internship. Plenty of candidates who are more than qualified get turned down, because the program is  &lt;em&gt;that selective&lt;/em&gt;! Their internships are among the most sought after in tech, and they’re hiring like crazy. Getting hired is a matter of persistence, hard work, and (unfortunately) luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the steps I outline here are the steps that I took, and your experience may vary a bit. What worked for me may not work for you, and vice versa. Also, I won’t go into verbose detail on the specifics of interview questions, as that would be unfair to Amazon and probably violate an NDA of some sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-0-prepare&quot;&gt;Step 0: Prepare&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You definitely don’t want to go into this blind, so the more time you have to prepare, the better. Once fall comes around though,  &lt;strong&gt;don’t delay applying.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will get your choice for the most part on working with Java, Python, C, C#, or C++. Stick with your most comfortable language and become really proficient at using it to work with data structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early stages of the interview process, knowing how to work with loops, arrays, and strings is vital. By the 3rd round however, you must be prepared to use more complicated data structures, like Sets, HashTables, and Queues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while it doesn’t seem to be a huge deal in the assessments early on, understanding time and space complexity is a vital skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of free online resources to help you in becoming proficient with the types of questions Amazon will throw your way. My favorite practice tool is Leetcode, which has countless questions that have been seen in real interviews. Another popular resource is Hackerrank, which is a similar tool. If all of the data structures that I mentioned sound foreign to you, don’t fret! It’s probably best to begin with a more academic approach.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=jeffmorhous-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0984782850&amp;amp;linkId=4a78609fe0a47db374e1fe62e0fba8a4&quot;&gt;Cracking The Coding Interview&lt;/a&gt;  is my favorite book for preparing for interviews, and it comes with hundreds of practice problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-1-apply&quot;&gt;Step 1: Apply&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have 2 options here: you can apply cold, or you can try to find someone to refer you. I’ve gotten an interview at Amazon both ways, but when a friend was kind enough to refer me the second time around, I was offered the first pre-screen almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The timeline you’re looking at is aggressive. For a summer internship, you’ll want to be sure to apply by  &lt;em&gt;October of the previous year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do your resume prep, find online resources and get feedback from peers and mentors! Once you’re ready, you can apply online. If you’re fortunate enough to have someone referring you, you’ll likely hear back within days. If not, there’s almost no telling. The first time I applied, I actually didn’t get pushed forward &lt;em&gt;until Spring&lt;/em&gt;  😅. The whole process took about a month for me, which feels like forever, especially when you’re excited!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the somewhat-obvious truth is that you don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Even if you’re the most qualified candidate on the planet, any company could pass you up for a number of reasons. Apply to dozens of other internships! After a few, it’ll become super natural and easy for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you begin the assessment process, it is without a doubt in your best interest to complete them all as fast as possible. You wouldn’t want to go through all this effort only to miss a deadline, or worse — find out that they hired their max # of interns even though you finished the assessments in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-2-pre-screen-1-&quot;&gt;Step 2: Pre-Screen #1 🐛&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pass the Resume screen, congrats!! The next step is typically a series of prescreens. To be respectful of your time, Amazon will send out the pre-screens in a series of progressively challenging stages. If you pass the first, you’ll get the second, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll get an email with some info on how to access and complete the pre-screen, and you’ll have under a week to execute. The assessment is online, and they’ll ensure you are working on your own by requiring access to record your camera, screen, and microphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without going into too much detail (wouldn’t want to spoil the fun 😉), you’ll spend most of your time finding and fixing bugs in code, already written in your choice Java, C++, or C. It can seem daunting at first but don’t get freaked out. I burned through 80% of my time before I even found my first bug, but once I spotted and fixed it, all of the others became immediately obvious to me. Most people try to overthink this stage, but it’s really just a test to see if you’re familiar with programming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-3-pre-screen-2-&quot;&gt;Step 3: Pre-Screen #2 🤔&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were able to fix “enough” of the bugs in the first assessment, you’ll get an email in a few days with instructions for the second. No one is quite sure what constitutes “enough.” I solved all of them, and I’ve heard of people getting pushed on having solved 75% of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, you’ll be asked to solve puzzle-like problems using your choice of Java, Python, C, C#, or C++ (Technical part of the interview). After a few of those, you’ll go through a “work-style” simulation, which constitutes the behavioral part of the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this part, having a working answer seems to be more important than efficiency. Obviously, if you can do both, DO IT. But I only had time to implement brute force solutions that passed most (a few pesky ones trailed) of the test cases — and that still got me through!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stage has questions that match what Leetcode typically classifies as “medium” problems, and there will probably be about 3 of them. If you can quickly solve medium level problems on Leetcode, this will be no sweat for you. If you find them tricky, put in some practice and then give it your best shot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-3-pre-screen-3-&quot;&gt;Step 3: Pre-Screen #3 ⏱&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last part is brutally long, at an estimated 2.5 hours to complete. It consists of a workday simulation and a logic test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workday simulation is actually both fun and stressful. It’s very much made to be game-like while assessing how you perform under pressure. You’ll be presented with problems (like missing deadlines, buggy code, arrogant coworkers), and asked you how’d respond. It’s important that you’re honest, and if your responses line up with Amazon’s leadership principals, you’ll likely pass no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part is a logic test, which feels a lot like the ACT had a baby with a Mensa test. Likely designed to get a feel for  &lt;em&gt;how you think&lt;/em&gt;, the test is really hard to prepare for! If you really want to get a feel for what it’ll be like, practice with some fun Logic/IQ tests online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-4-final-interview-&quot;&gt;Step 4: Final Interview 🙌&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you performed well enough on all 3 steps, a recruiter will likely reach out to schedule a phone interview! Even getting here is a great accomplishment, so congratulate yourself on a job well done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I turned down that final round interview because by that point, I had happily accepted an offer at another company. Once I knew that I wouldn’t be taking the job even if it was offered to me, I let the Recruiter know so as to respect their time. Amazon is a great company, but I ended up going somewhere that feels like a better fit for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, there’s no telling how I would have performed on that final interview! Because I didn’t follow through on the last stage of the interview, I won’t speak too much to it. I hear they typically ask one or two questions similar to the ones you saw in the second assessment. The biggest difference is that you’ll want to explain your design decisions to the interview to show an understanding of programming principals, rather than just cranking out code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that the person you speak with  &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to see you succeed, so don’t be intimidated. Ask lots of questions and don’t be afraid to say when you don’t know something!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Start a New Application with Vue.js and Vuetify</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vue.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  is an open source JavaScript framework created and maintained by a vibrant and passionate community. Although it’s  &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; new to the web apps world, Vue is quickly gaining ground on the more popular alternatives, React and Angular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While remarkably useful, Vue.js by itself isn’t necessarily pretty. Sure, we could build out all the components we need, customizing CSS to fit our design patterns, but there’s a far easier way.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuetifyjs.com/en/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vuetify&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  is a component framework that follows Material Design concepts. In short, it’s a massive UI library that plays really nicely with Vue. Things like forms, buttons, app bars, and even spinners can be used almost instantly, accelerating our front-end labor to an unbelievable pace. Beyond this, it all but ensures we’re following a consistent design pattern, which boosts our user experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s get down to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-0-optional-version-control-&quot;&gt;Step 0 (optional): Version Control 💪&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always a good idea to start version control when you start your project. Head over to github.com and create a new repository with whatever name you want. Click the “Initialize this repository with a README” button, then hit “Create Repository”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*aE4NJYbzLbjyh1wLBaQLcw.png?q=20&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3616/1*aE4NJYbzLbjyh1wLBaQLcw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a new repository on Github&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next clone your repo either via SSH or HTTP from the command line with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ git clone &amp;lt;the-link-github-provides&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your terminal, move into the directory that just got cloned with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ cd &amp;lt;my-repo-name&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not familiar with git and want to be,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jlord.us/git-it/&quot;&gt;“Git-it” is a wonderful tutorial&lt;/a&gt;  that runs you through most everything you’ll need to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-install-vue-cli&quot;&gt;Step 1: Install Vue Cli&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vue CLI (command line interface) is by far the fastest and easiest way to create the scaffolding needed for a Vue.js project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s some  &lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html&quot;&gt;documentation on installing it here&lt;/a&gt;, but if you have npm installed already, it’s as simple as running the following in our terminal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ npm install -g @vue/cli
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-create-vue-project&quot;&gt;Step 2: Create Vue Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the command line interface installed, to create a new project, we just need to run the following in the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ vue create my-app
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should replace “my-app” with your desired app name of course! You’ll be prompted for some customization options here, but I’ve always been happy with the defaults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*lQVstwloZEP6oT1BOLqS6Q.png?q=20&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/4124/1*lQVstwloZEP6oT1BOLqS6Q.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire up your code editor of choice. For most things,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;I use VS code&lt;/a&gt;. It’s lightweight and incredibly customizable, not to mention free, perfect for Vue.js development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now have a functional Vue.js app created! This is a great place to commit 😃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-add-vuetify-&quot;&gt;Step 3: Add Vuetify 🔮&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move your working directory into the app that was just created with (of course, replace my-app with the name you gave the  &lt;em&gt;vue create&lt;/em&gt;  command)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ cd my-app
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we can set up our app to use Vuetify by simply running the following command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ vue add vuetify
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see your new beautiful web app, run the start script (either yarn serve or npm run dev) and view it in your browser!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the command line tool recommends, this is a great place to commit your changes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-and-beyond-adding-components-and-customization&quot;&gt;Step 4 and Beyond: Adding Components and Customization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have Vuetify hooked up to Vue, adding crazy complex and appealing components is as easy as one liners. Go through the documentation and see what components might be useful to you. Take a look at the resources below to see what you can do. Actually getting components to do things is more of a Vue.js skill, so their docs and various tutorials will be helpful to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Block Ads for Your Entire Home Network with a Raspberry Pi</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I got a Raspberry Pi for my birthday last year and have been &lt;em&gt;suffering analysis paralysis&lt;/em&gt;, trying to figure out what I want to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently came across some  &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/&quot;&gt;open source software called Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt;, that boasts the ability to block ads for your entire network. Perplexed, I had to see how this worked, so here’s how I set up my Raspberry Pi to act as a black hole for all things advertisement related. Not only will you experience a (mostly)  &lt;strong&gt;ad-free internet&lt;/strong&gt;, but things like Smart-TV’s and other “sketchy” analytics tools won’t be able to send their data home.  &lt;strong&gt;Hurray privacy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, leave a response below or feel free to  &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jeffmorhous&quot;&gt;tweet me!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-1-aquire-hardware-&quot;&gt;Step 1: Aquire Hardware 🖥&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is an incredibly cheap computer, which makes it a great candidate for such a specific task. I’ll put affiliate links to each of the items that I purchased below, for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LPLPBS8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=jeffmorhous-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01LPLPBS8&amp;amp;linkId=f500311a42eb9157e8bb09d28fbbdb0d&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raspberry Pi Model 3 Model B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which costs roughly $50. I actually bought  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BC7BMHY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=jeffmorhous-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07BC7BMHY&amp;amp;linkId=4ea6501768e21eee68c1c20cbe40108d&quot;&gt;a kit that has a power supply and case&lt;/a&gt;, which you may want to do as well. It’s wireless, so I didn’t need an adapter. However, if you buy a model without WiFi, you will need to either wire it into your router with an ethernet cable or buy a WiFi adapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need a  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073JYVKNX/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=jeffmorhous-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B073JYVKNX&amp;amp;linkId=df3f3cfdac52cbe11f25e46a1c32d62e&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;microSD card&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  to store the operating system (more on that later). If your computer doesn’t have an SD Card Reader, you’ll need an  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00W02VHM6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=jeffmorhous-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00W02VHM6&amp;amp;linkId=68cd82405719a6437a054f482d20e3ed&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SD card reader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have it already, you’ll need a simple keyboard. I’m going to assume you have some kind of HDMI display available, like a relatively modern TV, but if you don’t you’ll need that too.  &lt;em&gt;(There is a way to set up a Pi without a keyboard, mouse, or even a screen. It’s called a headless setup, and if you do this, then you can go ahead and skip to step 4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-2-install-an-operating-system-&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Install An Operating System 👨‍💻&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is pretty bare-bones. You can choose your operating system, and I went with  &lt;strong&gt;Raspbian&lt;/strong&gt;, an open source port of the Linux operating system.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/&quot;&gt;You can find the downloads here&lt;/a&gt;  — it’ll take a hot second, so go ahead and hit download and feel free to read ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put your microSD card in your computer directly or through whatever adapters necessary. An important note is that I’m on mac, so my instructions here will be as such.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/3&quot;&gt;If you’re on Windows, here’s some more generic instructions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.balena.io/etcher/&quot;&gt;Download balenaEtcher to help us install Raspbian on the SD card.&lt;/a&gt;  Run the .dmg to install it and fire it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3212/1*zckppIkSuGw56jJ-w1IOqg.png&quot; alt=&quot;balenaEtcher on my machine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the blue “select image,” and find the .iso file of Raspbian that you downloaded. Ensure that the center selection is set to your SD card, and hit FLASH! Again, this will probably take a minute ⏰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, eject your SD card and put it in your Pi. Plug in your monitor/TV, keyboard, and mouse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-3-customize-some-pi-settings&quot;&gt;Step 3: Customize Some Pi Settings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pi will ask you for your country and timezone, and then to change the default password — which you’ll definitely want to do for security reasons. Next, your Pi will probably want to update. Again, for security, go ahead and let it do that.  &lt;em&gt;This is probably the longest wait.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;youll-also-want-to-enable-ssh-so-you-can-control-the-pi-remotely-&quot;&gt;You’ll also want to enable SSH, so you can control the Pi remotely 😃&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, open up the terminal in your pie by clicking the icon in the top left corner. Run the following command to get access to ssh (all of these should be run in your pi’s terminal, not your main computer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sudo apt get install ssh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enable it with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set it to enable ssh every time it boots up with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sudo update-rc.d ssh defaults&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get your Pi’s IP address, run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hostname -I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-we-switch-back-over-to-your-macs-terminal-where-you-run-the-following&quot;&gt;Now we switch back over to your mac’s terminal, where you run the following&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ssh pi@YOUR.PI.IP.ADDRESS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And BINGO, enter your password and you now have remote access to your Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: It’s also a good idea to change your default SSH port, but we won’t go over that here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-4-install-pi-hole&quot;&gt;Step 4: Install Pi-hole&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either in your Pi’s terminal or your computer’s terminal connected to the Pi via SSH, run the following command from Pi-hole’s website to install it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;bash&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installer will run and ask a bunch of questions. It’s okay to choose the defaults, but feel free to customize like I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the installer finishes it’ll show you the password it selected. Note this and copy it, then change the web dashboard password by executing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pihole -a -p&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-5-configure-devices-or-router&quot;&gt;Step 5: Configure Devices or Router&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that your Pi-hole is acting as a DNS server, we need to make sure that your devices use it instead of your ISP. You can do this on a per-device basis, but I’d recommend changing it at your router. That way, every time a device on your network makes a DNS request, it will first go through the Pi-hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step is very specific to the brand of router, so I won’t go into detail. Essentially you need to tell your router to treat your Pi-hole as a DNS server, rather than your ISP. You should also reserve a static IP address for your Pi to ensure it’s IP does not change because this would break your setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Voila, enjoy your ad-free internet! 🙌&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;optional-how-pi-hole-works-&quot;&gt;Optional: How Pi-hole Works 🎓&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal Ad-Blockers allow advertisements to load and just hide them from your view. Once you’ve gotten the Pi-hole up and running, advertisements will stop dead in their tracks, before they even begin to download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pi-hole is a very specific  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole&quot;&gt;DNS sinkhole&lt;/a&gt;. DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it is the protocol for connecting names (like medium.com) to IP addresses (&lt;a href=&quot;https://myip.ms/info/whois/104.16.120.127&quot;&gt;104.16.120.127&lt;/a&gt;), which is where websites/servers really live on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DNS sinkhole acts in place of your usual DNS provider to provide false results. This pretty much breaks your internet — NEAT! With Pi-hole, everything that isn’t an Ad gets forwarded to your DNS provider,  &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; if the domain name is in Pi-hole’s blacklist (which is customizable for the nerdiest among you), then the Pi-hole sends back a fake IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you visit a website and it loads. Next, the website asks its ad provider for ads, and Pi-hole says “What ad provider? That doesn’t exist.” And boom your ads are gone. This can actually speed up your network, as you won’t be using as much bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting note is that Pi-hole won’t kill youtube ads, as youtube serves its content and advertisements from the same DNS, so killing youtube ads would also kill youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How I Use Todoist To Organize My Life As A Student</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-i-care&quot;&gt;Why Should I Care?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failing to plan is planning to fail.  I stand by the idea that careful planning is  &lt;strong&gt;THE KEY&lt;/strong&gt;  to being successful at anything you want to do. Investing time and energy into a carefully curated planner (as well as calendar) will pay dividends on your way to success. Keeping up with this will let you get done the things you want, in the midst of getting done the things you must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot going on. I’m a student, an app developer, a freelance developer, a roommate, a job seeker, a boyfriend, the list goes on. I used to keep all my school assignments in a little planner notebook, and pencil in other stuff for life. All too often, this would lead to confusion and chaos, as I forgot important things that weren’t related to school,  &lt;strong&gt;things I actually wanted to do more than homework&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I found  &lt;a href=&quot;https://win.todoist.com/overview&quot;&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt;. Todoist is a handy application that I have on my phone, iPad, and Macbook. It lets me dump all those tedious tasks into one place, so my mind is free to work unencumbered by the stress that I might have something coming up that I forgot about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-organize-my-projects&quot;&gt;How I Organize My “Projects”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first week of the semester, I dump everything from every class into Todoist, and then never think about that again. It’s a ton of work upfront, but I put in every homework assignment, project, paper, and exam into Todoist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3876/1*l4c0EtvQfiD57weaZ1f0uA.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Todoist Setup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have quite a few projects, because I try to never add a task without assigning it to a project. The first one is  &lt;strong&gt;Self Care&lt;/strong&gt;, which a lot of general stuff falls into. The next is  &lt;strong&gt;Financial&lt;/strong&gt;, where I keep track of things like bills and have tasks to review my budget. The next is  &lt;strong&gt;Career&lt;/strong&gt;, where I track things I do for my long term career, like interview prep, reading, or writing articles like this one. The next is  &lt;strong&gt;School&lt;/strong&gt;, and here I put all administrative school tasks 😥. Beneath it, I have a project for each of my classes — I’m super excited for web apps this semester! After that, I have a project called  &lt;strong&gt;Freelancing&lt;/strong&gt;, where I put administrative stuff for the freelance development work I do (sending invoices, finding clients, etc). I have a subproject for each client I’ve had beneath that as well. I also have a project for all my  &lt;strong&gt;Apartment&lt;/strong&gt; necessities, like chores and meal prep. Another project is for  &lt;strong&gt;My Girlfriend,&lt;/strong&gt;  where I’ll put little things like picking up flowers or planning dates.  &lt;strong&gt;General Tech&lt;/strong&gt; is used to hold things like sorting through photos, tidying up my hard drive, and other small computer stuff. Lastly,  &lt;strong&gt;Side Projects&lt;/strong&gt;  holds todo’s for different side projects I work on, like  &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=morhous.jeffery.mockmywords&amp;amp;hl=en_us&quot;&gt;Mock My Words.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably noticed that I have emoji’s next to each project, this is a must for keeping things nice and positive 🤩. Combine this with color coordination, and auditing how you’re spending your time becomes super easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days I’ll have a dozen tasks, some days I’ll have none (vacation is great). The important thing, is that at the end of the day, all your tasks are either complete or rescheduled. This ensures that you don’t have a ton of overdue tasks just piling up, because thats discouraging and MESSY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-hard-deadline-tasks&quot;&gt;Adding Hard Deadline Tasks👨‍💻&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A planner like this is most helpful when you have access to it all the time. Having it on my phone, iPad, and computer ensures that whenever I find out I need (&lt;em&gt;or want&lt;/em&gt;) to do something, I can jot down whatever it is really quick, and then not have to worry about remembering it. You’d be surprised how much mental capacity this frees up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todoist is crazy smart. It will recognize plenty of keyboard shortcuts. Let’s say a professor for my sociology course assigns a paper due on February 10th.. Here’s what I’ll type into Todoist — (if you’re on a computer, you can hit “Q” to open the new task prompt)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Paper Due #Sociology p1 Feb 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a task with the title “Paper Due”, puts it in the project “Sociology”, gives it a due date of February 10th, and assigns it a priority 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use priorities because sometimes there’s not enough time in the day, and it’s nice to see what absolutely has to get done really easily. School assignments always get a priority 1 (p1), because I try to make a habit of doing those on time 😆 . The priorities are also color coded red, yellow, blue, and grey in that order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-no-deadline-tasks-&quot;&gt;Adding NO Deadline Tasks 🤔&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, there’s something I just  &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;  to get done but it doesn’t necessarily have a due date. I just don’t want to forget about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todoist helps with that too! At some point recently, I did a  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeffmorhous.github.io/&quot;&gt;website redesign&lt;/a&gt;. I put dozens of incremental steps for this as tasks in my “Side Projects” project, and ordered them in the order that I wanted to. Then, when I new I had some time to work on one of them, I’d tag it with “today” to add it to my daily list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;breaking-down-tasks-&quot;&gt;Breaking Down Tasks 💡&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have a big task, like a paper, it’s common that I’ll add some subtasks to help me make progress towards it. Things like “Write Comprehensive Outline,” “Write 3 Pages of Rough Draft,” and “Go Over With Professor In Office Hours” ensure that I’m not procastinating. It can be incredibly deceptive to see something like “Mail Letter” and “Write 30 Page Paper,” thinking they’ll take the same amount of time. Break things down! Then, assign those subtasks a lower priority then the main task, and give them each a due date!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you ask, no this article isn’t an advertisement. This app has just been so helpful in helping me organize that I thought it would be great to share. I hope you find it as helpful as I have. By no means do I think my way is the only way when it comes to organization. It works for me, and it will probably work for you. But &lt;strong&gt;you know what would work even better for you? A system you tweak to your liking&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
