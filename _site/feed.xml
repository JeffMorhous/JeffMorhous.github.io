        <title>Why You Can't Focus</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Being able to devote your full attention to something is fundamental to thriving in any area of life, so why is it so hard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Cal Newport’s cult-favorite “Deep Work”, he says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, “Deep Work” is putting all of our energy into one task, to accomplish something that can’t easily be replicated. Think of the last time you had to write a term paper, study for a math exam, or complete a deliverable at work. If you’re anything like me, you probably remember the constant negotiation with yourself to actually work on the task at hand. I often find myself wanting to reach for my phone, grab a snack, water my succulent, honestly anything but what I’ve set out to do. Of course, guilt quickly follows. Does that make me a bad person/student/programmer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. &lt;strong&gt;Everyone experiences resistance to mentally or physically taxing labor to some extent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;novel-stimuli&quot;&gt;Novel stimuli&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human brain is wired to  &lt;strong&gt;seek out novel stimuli&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s simply how we’ve stayed alive for so long. When a deer runs into the road while we’re driving, our attention instantly shifts to it, prompting us to act to avoid the danger. That same instinctual response to new and interesting things in our surroundings is what makes it so hard to get focused work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mind is always on the lookout for something more interesting than what it’s currently honed in on. The same thing that keeps you alive is to blame for  &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt;  all procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overcoming-it&quot;&gt;Overcoming It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a careful balance necessary between work that is too boring and work that is too hard. If you can convince yourself that you’re interested in something, and work enough to understand it, all that’s left to do is devote your attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there’s lots of things we can do to get into a flow state of hyper-focused attention easier. For me, it’s all about routine. When I set out to do truly deep work, I like to sit down with a drink (pop, tea, coffee, etc), put on some headphones, and get to work. I try not to sit at a desk with music and tea unless I’m doing work, so when I start that routine my mind already knows what’s about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any skill,  &lt;strong&gt;practice works wonders&lt;/strong&gt;. 
Think of the time you spend focusing as an investment in any future time you need to focus. Each time it get’s a little easier to fight off distractions for just a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Switching From iPad to iPad Pro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using an iPad for about 3 years, and I absolutely love it. Too often I hear tech-enthusiasts blast it as an underpowered toy computer for grandmothers — and &lt;em&gt;wow&lt;/em&gt; is that underselling it. For the most part, I’ve used my iPad as a leisure device. Since most of my work and education is done on a computer, it’s nice to feel a little separation when I want to unwind with something digital. The more I used it though, the more likely I was to reach for my iPad for professional tasks. When my college went 100% online back in March, it became a precious part of my workflow. Since I almost use my iPad more than my computer (except on workdays.. 8 hours of screen time is plenty), I made the jump over to the iPad pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, there aren’t dozens of selling points to go with an iPad pro over the regular iPad, especially since the base iPad now supports Apple Pencil. But I’m still glad I did it! There are however inarguable improvements that make the iPad Pro a joy to own and use for leisure, work, and school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;apple-pencil-2&quot;&gt;Apple Pencil 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apple Pencil 2 is no doubt better than the original. For some reason, the base iPad is only comparable with the original Apple Pencil. They really listened to every complaint about their first generation pencil and solved pretty much all of them. For starters, this generation of the pencil magnetically attaches to the side of the iPad Pro for super convenient storage and &lt;strong&gt;charging&lt;/strong&gt;! Beyond that, the pencil is no longer &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; round. Since it sports one flat edge, the pencil is less prone to roll off the table onto the floor. You make think that’s a minor issue, but I can testify that my Apple Pencil 1 would roll onto the floor during a lecture at least a few times a week. In the “real” pencil world, you’d be hard pressed to find one that is completely round. Lastly, the pencil has a touch sensor, which apps can customize to allow actions (like tool switching) with just a tap on the side of the pencil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;usb-c&quot;&gt;USB-C&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This right here&lt;/em&gt; is a crowd favorite. The original iPad (and every iPhone to date) charges with Apple’s proprietary “Lightning” connector. The iPad Pro on the other hand uses the ubiquitous “USB-C” connector that’s become popular on smartphones, computers (including MacBooks), and tablets around the world. Again, a very small but welcome improvement. If you’re wondering why it matters, I can now leave the house with my iPad and MacBook, and &lt;em&gt;1 cord to charge them both&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;screen-size&quot;&gt;Screen Size&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screen size and lack of bezel is the first thing you’ll notice if you put an iPad and a Pro next to each other. The iPad I switched from was a 10.2 inch, while the iPad Pro I switched to is an 11 inch. This doesn’t seem like a lot of difference on paper, but the trimmed bezel makes it feel like a whole different class of device. Combine this with the square edges (as opposed to rounded on the base iPad), and it’s easy to see the iPad Pro in a class of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;display-quality&quot;&gt;Display Quality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base level iPad sports 264 pixels per inch with 500 nits brightness. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro boasts 264 pixels per inch with 600 nits of brightness. The Pro’s display also comes with a fully laminated display with anti-reflective coating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in less technical terms, the two iPads have the same resolution, but the Pro comes with an optionally brighter display that is also laminated and reduces glare. The difference here is marginal, but it’s definitely noticeable and worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stereo-speakers&quot;&gt;Stereo Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually had no idea of this until I was watching Netflix on the iPad Pro one evening. The base level iPad has some speakers on one end of it, and they’re nothing to write home about. (the reader may note that here I am, writing about it 🤷‍♂️). On the other hand, the Pro comes with 4 speakers. When holding it in landscape mode, there are &lt;em&gt;2 speakers on each side of the device.&lt;/em&gt; I can’t imagine taking much advantage of this serendipitous stereo discovery, but it’s another subtle difference that separates this iPad into its own class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;face-id&quot;&gt;Face ID&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base level iPad comes with Touch ID, a fingerprint sensor used to unlock the iPad and authenticate for various transactions. But much like newer iPhones, the iPad Pro comes with Face ID, which lets you authenticate by just looking at the iPad. Am I lazy for loving this? Maybe, but it certainly makes using a password manager the easiest thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lidar&quot;&gt;LiDAR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one really knows why LiDAR was included in this years revision of the iPad Pro, but no one is complaining. LiDAR is an additional sensor that acts like radar but uses lasers. Already, this enables the device to deliver next-generation augmented reality experiences. Not many apps take advantage of this yet, but consider this a future-proofing hardware enhancement. Already, apps like Ikea let you see how furniture would look in your house. While this experience is delivered on most iOS devices, the LiDAR sensor makes them darn close to flawless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPad Pro definitely deserves it’s “Pro” name, even if it’s not obvious at first glance. All of these subtle improvements over the base model really pull together for a best-in-class experience. I definitely won’t tell you which iPad to buy, but I’m super happy with the Pro 😉&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Switching To The Brave Browser</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Chrome since around its release, but ditched it last year over privacy concerns. Google has a really big interest in having its eye on everything you do online so it can find a way to profit off of it, which was a little frustrating for me. After some experimenting, I ended up on Safari, which touted some pretty sweet privacy features, mostly in the area of blocking website’s attempts to follow you across the web. This worked out for a while, but I ended up having to keep Chrome installed, because &lt;em&gt;a shockingly high amount of websites only bother checking to make sure things work in Chrome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole experience of trying to avoid Chrome has definitely been frustrating, but I’ve stuck to it mostly out of spite. A month or so ago, I discovered Brave, and have been loving it. It works and feels like Chrome, but protects your privacy like Firefox or Safari. Beyond that, it even has some decent ad-blocking features and an interesting method for ensuring creators continue to get paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should at least check it out, so here’s a few highlights to make it easier on you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chromium&quot;&gt;Chromium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromium is a free, open source browser from Google itself 😱&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chromium shouldn’t be confused with Chrome, which is one of Google’s most impressive pieces of spyware. Chromium is a bare-bones web browser that &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; can expand upon. Google uses Chromium as the basis for Chrome, and Brave uses Chromium as the basis for itself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing the engine with Chromium provides a ton of benefits. Let’s be honest — most of the world uses Chrome as it’s default browser. It’s gone so far as to become a meme that Safari/Edge are only used to install Chrome and then never touched again. The downside to this is that people who build websites, tend to make them work best on Chrome. I’ve had plenty of problems with websites in Safari, including Youtube and Netflix 😒&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Brave is built on the same skeleton that Chrome is, &lt;strong&gt;websites work as if you were using Chrome&lt;/strong&gt;. Even further, &lt;strong&gt;you can use Chrome Extensions!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ad-blocking&quot;&gt;Ad Blocking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad blocking is the thing that brings most people to the Brave browser. Brave blocks harmful ads that try to identify and track you across the internet. Yes you’ll still see ads, but you can expect them to be fewer and further between. When you do see an ad, it is far less likely to be trying to identify you at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want, you can also opt-in to Brave’s custom ads. The company recognizes that advertisements enable creators to make content for everyone to enjoy, and just making advertisements vanish isn’t fair to everyone. You can choose to see occasional ads served up by the browser itself, and they will distribute a portion of the earnings from those advertisements to participating creators across the web. So if you spend all your time reading the New York Times, the idea is for that site to get all of the revenue generated by the advertisements you see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tracker-blocking&quot;&gt;Tracker Blocking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond ad-blocking, Brave also blocks many attempts by websites to identify and exploit you. It starts by blocking fingerprinting techniques, which is where a website will collect as much information about you as possible, that it can identify your return visits even if you delete cookies and use a VPN. Brave goes one step further and stops cross-site cookies, which are yet another attempt for a website to observe your behavior &lt;em&gt;after you leave the website&lt;/em&gt; 😒&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-browsing-with-tor&quot;&gt;Private Browsing With Tor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want, Brave will let you browse using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29&quot;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;, which is an open-source system for anonymous communication. In short, it works by routing requests through multiple servers and encrypting it each step of the way. Today it is maintained by its own non-profit, which states the following about it’s use -&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We, at the Tor Project, fight every day for everyone to have private access to an uncensored internet, and Tor has become the world’s strongest tool for privacy and freedom online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, all that to say, Brave’s private browsing is a whole lot more private than Chrome’s “private” browsing. I’ve not actually used this feature though, as routing things through Tor slows your experience substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;brave-is-a-browser-that-feels-and-acts-a-lot-like-chrome-but-lets-you-step-outside-the-google-ecosystem-and-retake-control-over-some-of-your-digital-footprint&quot;&gt;Brave is a browser that feels and acts a lot like Chrome, but lets you step outside the Google ecosystem and retake control over some of your digital footprint.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        <title>My Favorite Productivity Tips</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If a craftsman wants to do good work, he must first sharpen his tools. — Confucius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In math words, productivity typically is units of output per unit of time. Talking about our own work that way makes us feel like machines, and is a bit too reductionist. When I think of productivity, I think about getting done what I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to get done in time so that I can do what I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to get done. However you define it, productivity matters to you whether you’re a student, knowledge worker, parent, landscaper, or anything in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;em&gt;freelancer&lt;/em&gt;, increasing my productivity has allowed me to increase the amount of money I can make per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;em&gt;student&lt;/em&gt;, focusing on productivity ensures that I stay on top of my coursework while still enjoying the meaningful things in life, like walks in the woods with my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve compiled a list of my favorite productivity tips that I’ve discovered in the last few years, and I hope you find them as helpful as I have. — &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;daily-highlight-&quot;&gt;Daily Highlight 🔍&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is concept is pretty new to me, and it comes from the book “Make Time” by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. They advocate for picking a single priority for the day and putting as much energy as possible into it. As someone who typically makes obsessively detailed lists for my days, this is a little bit odd to me — So of course I tried it out for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QR8pokk11W5EEBI0jOzgGA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Reading “Make Time” with a view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book (which I cannot recommend enough), the authors explain that todo lists aren’t focused enough, and long term goals are too hard to measure progress towards. Whenever you sit down to do work, whatever that looks like for your occupation, you should &lt;strong&gt;write down the one thing that matters most to you for the time you’re about to spend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing this for about 2 weeks now, and it’s helped me in a few different ways. For one, it keeps me honest and focused on what matters most. I’m far less likely to get sucked into reading documentation when I know my highlight for the day is to “Finish Writing New Tests”. But beyond that, &lt;em&gt;it gives me greater satisfaction as I stop working for the day.&lt;/em&gt; Even if I miss some other todo items, it’s remarkably rewarding to set out what I accomplish to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend setting a highlight at the beginning of your work/school times. If the concept interests you more, then you’d enjoy the book! &lt;em&gt;They don’t give me anything for saying that&lt;/em&gt; 🤷‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deep-work-&quot;&gt;Deep Work 🤫&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport (there’s that name again 🤷‍♂️) says ‘Deep work’ is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. He has a lot of things to say on the subject, so much so that he wrote a whole book about it. In the aptly titled “Deep Work” he argues that our constantly distracting digital tools stop us from getting meaningful work done in normal quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the idea is that you do your best work when you’re completely focused on one thing for an extended period of time. If you say, need to write a 5 page paper, that’s deep work. Checking your email however, is “shallow work.” In the past, I’ve broken down tasks like writing a 5 page paper into small intervals to make it manageable, but this often leads to lost time and a lower quality product, as your brain is spending too much time going in and out of the deep work “zone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to approach something with deep work, is to schedule some time for it, a process called “time blocking,” and then focus on that thing, eliminating distractions like notifications or meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a pretty cool startup called Clockwise that produces a tool that will automatically rearrange your meetings (and subsequently, your colleague’s calendars) to allow you as large of a contiguous block of free time as possible to get deep work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my favorite blog post that explains more on deep work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doist.com/blog/deep-work/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Work: The Complete Guide (Including a Step-by-Step Checklist)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pomodoro-&quot;&gt;Pomodoro ⏰&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pomodoro is my go-to strategy for getting myself moving when I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don’t want to. Inertia extends beyond a force of nature and into our professional lives. If we’re already really productive, it tends to be nice and easy to do the next task. If we’ve been slugging around for a while, it can become incredibly hard just to get moving on that first thing. However, once most people get started, they find that getting past that initial friction is all they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pomodoro relies on the inertia rule of productivity to get things done in short intervals with breaks as a reward system. The idea is you set a work timer, typically for 25 minutes, and focus on one task for the entire period. Then, you take a 5 minute break to be a sloth again and repeat as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work for 25 minutes, take a five minute break.&lt;/strong&gt; If you do this twice, you will have accomplished 50 minutes of high quality work in just 1 hour, which is a win no matter how you look at it. This technique conflicts a bit with the philosophy of deep work given it advocates for short time periods, but it does protect your attention while you work, which is an absolute must. Most importantly, it gets you over that initial friction from getting started. It’s really hard to convince yourself to study for 4 hours, but it’s really easy to convince yourself to study for 25 minutes 🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;regular-sleep-&quot;&gt;Regular Sleep 😴&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep can make you more productive. It always seems like sleep can be a waste of time, right? I mean, to sleep 8 hours a night, we spend 1/3rd of our life &lt;em&gt;unconscious&lt;/em&gt;. How can that be productive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of sleep that way is a bit too reductionist. While we sleep, our brain does the necessary work to decompress, rest, and shift things from short term to long term storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the negative effects on your well-being, if you don’t sleep enough, or you sleep inconsistently, you will surely suffer professionally. I’ve found that sleeping 7–8 hours a night, every night, helps me to feel focused and healthy, freeing me to do my best work and enjoy life without having to make too many sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t look at sleep as a waste of time, but look at it as the best way to take care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;task-management-&quot;&gt;Task Management 👨‍🔬&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entire books have been written about task management, and dozens of applications are out there to help refine it. &lt;strong&gt;The single greatest benefit of keeping things you want and need to do in a written or digital system is the bandwidth it frees up in your mind&lt;/strong&gt;. Whenever a thought pops into my head, something like “Get a mothers day card for mom”, I throw it into my task app and my mind is free to resume doing real work. It seems tiny, but the pressure of trying to remember your responsibilities, no matter how large, can cost you &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any approach to keeping your tasks under control is better than no approach, but I tend to go as organized as possible. I prefer apps over paper, so that I can always access it, and it’s easy to move things around. Specifically, I use Todoist, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeffmorhous.com/how-i-use-todoist-to-organize-my-life-as-a-student/&quot;&gt;which I’ve written a whole article about.&lt;/a&gt; I throw things into the app as they come into my head, and at the beginning of every week I refine things to make sure each day is manageable in workload. I use the priorities feature to single out my highlight, a nod to my newest tip above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a todo app wouldn’t help you with your &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt;, it will help you with your &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;. Wouldn’t it be nice to be known as dependable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unplug-&quot;&gt;Unplug 🔌&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one seems obvious to me. Our minds are constantly stimulated, a condition that we’ve only faced for the last few decades. In his book, “Digital Minimalism,” Cal Newport advocates for a simple life free of constant digital distraction. Now, you don’t have to take all his advice, but a big takeaway is the &lt;strong&gt;mental benefit you receive from doing something outside of screens&lt;/strong&gt;, especially if all your work is done on a screen. This means, after a long day at the computer, watching TV isn’t necessarily the best option for your noggin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things like going on a walk, cooking, and investing in meaningful relationships all pay huge dividends on your productivity. We’re not built to work all the time, so if you let your work or low-quality leisure consume your life, you’ll find yourself struggling to compete with (and less happy than) your peers who take time to unplug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the thought of unplugging makes you nervous, it’s a good sign your brain needs that break even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-&quot;&gt;Reading 📖&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading gives you superpowers, simple as that. If you make reading a regular habit, your attention span will increase and strengthen, alongside your rapidly growing reading speed. Beyond that, you also absorb information from whatever you happen to be reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plenty of successful people make reading a priority in their life. Warren Buffet is known to spend 5–6 hours a day reading, while Bill Gates is known to pour through 50 books a year. When asked about his reading, Buffet said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading is a wonderfully relaxing and rewarding hobby that will push you towards success faster than any other.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Give Your ViewController An Activity Indicator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;UIKit provides a nifty little spinning wheel we can display to the user when we’re waiting on something that the user can’t see. It’s considered a best practice to pop one of these up when doing something like a network call, so the person using our app isn’t clueless as to what’s going on. Basically, you create the spinner, and add it to your view. Then, just before a background task like an API request, tell it to animate. When the background request finishes, you just tell it to stop animating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, declare your spinner in the ViewController&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;var activityIndicator = UIActivityIndicatorView(style: .Large)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside viewDidLoad, or a method called by viewDidLoad, add the spinner to your view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;activityIndicator.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
view.addSubview(activityIndicator)
activityIndicator.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor).isActive = true
activityIndicator.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor).isActive = **true**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you make your background task, start the spinner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;activityIndicator.startAnimating()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And when the background task completes, stop the spinner!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;self.activityIndicator.stopAnimating()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is such a small UI feature that has a huge benefit. If you implement it correctly, the people that use your app will probably never consciously notice it. But if you don’t implement this, users will likely feel like your app is slow, or mistake a normal wait time for a buggy freeze of the app. Hope you got some value out of this, I know your users will!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Customize UITextView</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So recently I’ve been working on an iOS version of my Mock My Words app. It’s pretty simple in functionality so I wanted to compensate with a nice user interface. The main functionality requires that a user enter (or paste) in text of pretty much any size. Oftentimes iOS text entry with a  &lt;strong&gt;UITextField&lt;/strong&gt;, but that only offers single line input. For multi-line input, you have to use  &lt;strong&gt;UITextView&lt;/strong&gt;  😔. After throwing that in my app I was rather unimpressed with how it looked. So, I decided to put my own spin on it. It took a bit of research and I’m pleased with how it turned out so I thought I’d share with the community on how customize the UITextView object to your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-the-uitextview&quot;&gt;Create the UITextView&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m building this app programmatically, so the first step is to instantiate the UITextView object. If you’re using a storyboard, you’ll want to create an IBOutlet and then follow the other steps the same. I declared my UITextView at the class level of the view controller it’s used in, and the one-line looks like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    **let** textBox = UITextView()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note, all of the following code should be executed by  &lt;em&gt;viewdidload()&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but feel free to extract it to a function and then call that function from viewDidLoad()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;add-it-to-the-view&quot;&gt;Add it to the view&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you have to add it to the view hierarchy so it actually shows up. If you’re using a storyboard, skip this step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    view.addSubview(textBox)textBox.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = **false**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-the-delegate&quot;&gt;Set the delegate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you actually want your app to react to actions the user may take, you need to make your view controller extend UITextViewDelegate, and then have the following line in your configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    textBox.delegate = **self**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;customize-the-textbox&quot;&gt;Customize the textbox&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use creative freedom here, but here’s how I laid out my textbox view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
5
6
7
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    textBox.autocorrectionType = .no
    textBox.text = placeholderText
    textBox.backgroundColor = .secondarySystemBackground
    textBox.textColor = .secondaryLabel
    textBox.font = UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .body)
    textBox.layer.cornerRadius = 20
    textBox.textContainerInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: 10, left: 10, bottom: 10, right: 10)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-it-a-shadow&quot;&gt;Give it a shadow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this is optional, but this is how I gave my textbox a shadow so it has a material design feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
5
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    textBox.layer.shadowColor = UIColor.gray.cgColor;
    textBox.layer.shadowOffset = CGSize(width: 0.75, height: 0.75)
    textBox.layer.shadowOpacity = 0.4
    textBox.layer.shadowRadius = 20
    textBox.layer.masksToBounds = **false**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-your-view-where-to-put-it&quot;&gt;Tell your view where to put it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your method for doing this will definitely vary, but I used&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    NSLayoutConstraint.activate([insert your array of constraints here])
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it! You have a custom textbox that kind of floats above the view you put it in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Set Up Programmatic Interfaces in iOS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of valid reasons to use storyboards or to programmatically lay out your interface. Storyboards let us quickly build out a beautiful interface, but face limitations and scale problems. If you have a team working on an app, then Storyboards can get messy and hard to keep track of with version control. Once you decide that storyboards aren’t the tool for you, Xcode takes some tinkering to set things up to lay out your interface in Swift. After you create your project,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First,  &lt;strong&gt;delete&lt;/strong&gt;  the  &lt;em&gt;Main.storyboard.&lt;/em&gt; Yup, delete it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we have to delete any reference to it- The first spot we need to take care of is the reference to  &lt;em&gt;Main.storyboard&lt;/em&gt;  in  &lt;em&gt;Info.plist&lt;/em&gt; — Go ahead and  &lt;strong&gt;delete the entry by clicking the minus sign&lt;/strong&gt;. The last place it’s referenced is in the  &lt;em&gt;Deployment Info&lt;/em&gt; section of your project settings. A dropdown for  &lt;em&gt;Main Interface&lt;/em&gt;  will still say Main.storyboard,  &lt;strong&gt;Select the empty option in the dropdown&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, add the following to your SceneDelegate.swift&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }
window = UIWindow(frame: windowScene.coordinateSpace.bounds)
window?.windowScene = windowScene
window?.rootViewController = ViewController()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can specify your actual layout in ViewController.swift!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re all set up to implement the design of your dreams programmatically, and  &lt;a href=&quot;https://softauthor.com/ios-ui-design-programmatically-xcode-9-swift-4&quot;&gt;here’s a quick reference to help you get the hang of it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Wirelessly Test Your App on Your iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A good thing to note is that the mac you are using Xcode on and the iPhone (or iPad) you want to test on  &lt;strong&gt;must be on the same network&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to the build button, go to select a device/simulator. Here, mine just says “&lt;em&gt;Generic iOS Device&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2284/1*4iGsUqTlI2w8rJ5ILnOBOw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you click on it, select “&lt;em&gt;Add Additional Simulators&lt;/em&gt;” The result will be a modal that looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3204/1*f5VkFuTfSE0pNmhsdPXmAA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and switch over to devices. Plug your device in and unlock it, and it should appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and click the checkbox that says “&lt;em&gt;Connect via network&lt;/em&gt;” and voila!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have to restart Xcode, but you should now be able to run your apps on your device without physically connecting it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty small trick but it may save you tons of time, and honestly it’s just too cool not to set up. Hope this helped, and if you ran in to trouble, let me know below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Switching From Android To iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used Android since roughly 2011, and would definitely classify myself as a fanboy. Now that I do quite a bit of iOS development for work, I finally made the jump over to using an iPhone full-time. Now that I’ve switched, I don’t know if I could ever go back. It’s not like I was completely oblivious to the iPhone before I switched — I’ve even been using an iPad for years and making iOS apps for quite some time. I’ve just been too reluctant to switch because I was so comfortable with my Android phone. In fact, the Galaxy S10e came out after the iPhone XR, so the iPhone XR is actually an older device! So what is it that makes me so pumped to now have an iPhone as my daily driver? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;big-name-apps-work-better&quot;&gt;Big-name apps work better&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple definitely has a majority market share of smartphones in the US. So that means, companies with a focus on the United States have an incentive to put more resources into their iOS apps, as opposed to Android. I’ve always known this and been kind of annoyed as an Android user. Now that I’m using an iPhone, I’m starting to really appreciate it 🤩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of apps look and act exactly the same on both platforms, and hats off to those companies. However, a lot of smaller things come to the iPhone first, and their iPhone apps often end up being more polished than their Android counterparts. Shockingly enough, this is the most evident in banking/finance apps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;things-just-work-like-magic&quot;&gt;Things just work like magic&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android’s open ecosystem is incredibly open and customizable. I’ve always loved this, and its one of the reasons I have stuck with it so long. However, this often results in manufactures or carriers making unnecessary changes to the OS for their own benefit (looking at you, Samsung). The Android software is built to fit an enormous range of hardware, and it’s begun to feel like a one-size-fits-none situation. Once I stopped being able to articulate what I specifically liked about Android over the iPhone, I decided to make the switch at least temporarily. I couldn’t be happier with the consistency of experience that Apple has provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating software with hardware in mind, and vice versa has clearly evident benefits. I’ve been using the iPhone for a little over a week now, and haven’t experienced any crashes or even lag. Even FaceID works 100 times more consistently than its Android counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-emphasis-on-design-is-notable&quot;&gt;The emphasis on design is notable&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m an engineer, so design isn’t exactly my strong suit.  I used to not even care about design, but the more I use computers and phones in my life, the more I want to actually &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; the experience.  This is especially magnified as I dive into a profession driven by creating positive software experiences for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s become pretty apparent that Android is  &lt;em&gt;engineered and then designed&lt;/em&gt;, while iOS is  &lt;em&gt;designed and then engineered.&lt;/em&gt; Color schemes, animation, and even sounds have surprised me with the level of detail invested. iMessage is without a doubt the most obvious example of this, specifically with the whole screen effect features 🤯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Emoji is just better. I used to never use emoji. Then I started using them on my mac because my girlfriend pointed out how much  &lt;em&gt;better they appeared&lt;/em&gt; than any other implementation I’ve seen. Emoji are supposed to communicate something better than text, and Apple really nails the fun element here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;syncing-with-my-macbook-is-too-convenient&quot;&gt;Syncing with my MacBook is too convenient&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having iMessage on both my phone and my MacBook is a pretty novel feature. Not incredibly useful but definitely nice to be able to respond to texts in the middle of using my Computer without having switch devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airdropping between my phone and computer has been pretty great too! Being able to transfer documents, pictures, and even links back and forth without emailing them is a bit of a time saver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just today, I got sent a link to a site that looked like garbage on mobile. All I had to do was open safari and click on the tab (from my MacBook) that was open on my iPhone, and ba-bam, I was in business on my MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the syncing is definitely not perfect. There’s a bit of a lag between my phone and computer, and I’ve often had my computer be ringing after I already answered a call on my phone. But still, the sync between the 2 is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;privacy-&quot;&gt;Privacy 🔐&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, Apple’s stance on encryption is bold and attractive to me as a consumer. They’ve shown in public that they’re willing to stand up to even the government to protect their users’ information, and that’s priceless in a time where the economy runs on personal information. If you use an Android phone, you’re all but consenting to have Google track everything about you. A great side effect of shifting to the iPhone is the option for more choice over disclosure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the switch from Android to the iPhone was a lot like my jump from Windows to Mac. It took me years to work up the guts but I’m definitely not regretting it. Yes, Apple charges significantly more for products that compare equally on a technical level. The “Apple Tax” is very real, and a barrier for many. If you’re trying to decide if that price jump is worth it for you, talk to some friends, and ask them what they like about their iPhone! Go into the Apple store and get hands-on with them 👨‍🔬&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Handle College at Home</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you one of the tens of thousands of college students who’ve been displaced recently? Lots of people are talking, writing, and reading about their transmission to  &lt;em&gt;remote work&lt;/em&gt;, but not much has been said about  &lt;em&gt;remote learning.&lt;/em&gt; A lot of the same concepts apply, but a lot differs! I was actually homeschooled for 12 years, which involved some online classes, and a lot of self-direction. In college, I’ve already taken a few online classes. Even my job has been remote for quite some time, and now (like you, I’m assuming) I’m forced to finish out my entire academic semester online as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not super worried about the transition, solely because it doesn’t change my lifestyle all too much. There’s still some adjustment, mostly being back home and coordinating with my parents, one of which is also WFH (working from home) in this tense time. Being left to your own devices AND being locked in your house requires a ton of self-discipline, and can definitely get to you really fast. Everyone is different, but there are some things that I know help me to be as productive and healthy as I can when working remotely. Here are some tips that I hope help you be as successful as you can. Build strong habits early, and you’ll be thanking yourself when online exams roll around the corner 🥴&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;recognize-the-situation&quot;&gt;Recognize the situation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2190/1*ex2Pfy4eGyvrhiaOqEEQ4Q.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt the world is hurting right now. You’re not alone. People everywhere are having their lives turned upside down. Remember, the world is not ending, but the steps we’re taking are indeed stopping it from ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all had the rug pulled out from under us. Your professors and peers are all in the same boat as you. We didn’t sign up for this (well some did, but if you signed up for online classes to begin with you probably could write this article). Be patient with your faculty as they work to deliver you the education that you paid for. Be patient with yourself — it would be really unusual to be at your peak productivity during a time of worldwide crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;create-a-space-for-school&quot;&gt;Create a space for school&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, watching lectures in bed and studying on the couch is sick and all(no pun intended), but it’s going to lead to devastating productivity losses. Some people can thrive wherever, but as we spend more and more time in our homes &lt;em&gt;a-la quarantine,&lt;/em&gt; it becomes increasingly important to remind your mind where work does and doesn’t happen. I work best in a closed room with a clean desk and an nice chair. But that’s not going to be possible for everyone all the time. Not everyone has a desk, I’m posted up at my parents kitchen table 👌. Just try your best to dedicate some physical space to your education, as it will certainly help you dedicate some mental space. Music and headphones are your friends for isolation, as it will help your drown out others sharing your school space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;create-a-time-for-school&quot;&gt;Create a time for school&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1212/1*umY_kJeLIXFkxDttK5iwyw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t “spring break forever,” though it still feels like that. It’s really important that you dedicate time during your day to “lectures” in whatever form they’ll take, in addition to the obligatory studying and homework. Turn off your phone, shut the door if you can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dedicating time to school will help you strike a healthy work-life balance. There’s no such thing as just leaving the tv on ‘in the background’ while you do practice exams. If you put your focus on school during the time you promised yourself you’d be doing it, your free time will be yours to spend entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;use-a-planner&quot;&gt;Use a planner&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of online classes is stupid hard. Professors may or may not remind you of things that are due, and it’s certainly not their responsibility to keep you organized. Write everything down and prioritize your days. A lot of people find it easiest to do this digitally — I use Todoist,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/swlh/how-i-use-todoist-to-organize-my-life-as-a-student-8c95d5597a1d?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=5cdc006415567f1db52f83684016fe1a&quot;&gt;and I already wrote a piece about how it helps me stay organized.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;communicate-with-your-family&quot;&gt;Communicate with your family&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re at home for the long haul like me, this is going to take some adjusting for everyone. Be clear with them that you need undisturbed time to dedicate to your studies in order to succeed. It’s crazy hard to get deep work done if you’re constantly being interrupted, even if the interruptions are important. If you attention is absolutely need during your school time, help you family understand how to get that message across while still respecting your headspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;get-dressed&quot;&gt;Get Dressed&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to just lounge around in pajamas all day, and that’s totally fine. However, if you get up and get ready for the day like you were going to be out and about, it helps remind your mind that this isn’t a snow day. Hygiene and lifestyle habits will do wonders for your mental health!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these tips not withstanding, remote work gives you the freedom to break these rules when needed. Use this wild pandemic to take advantage of the autonomy remote work offers. Who knows, you may discover that your top job desire is the opportunity for remote work.&lt;/p&gt;
