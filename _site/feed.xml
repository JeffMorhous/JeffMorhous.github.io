        <title>How I Built and Launched a SaaS App In 2 Days</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A little over a week ago, I launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://findrailswork.com&quot;&gt;RailsWork&lt;/a&gt;, a job board for Ruby on Rails developers. In this post I‚Äôm going to talk about the why of my project and also the how, and the tools I‚Äôve used along the way. Feel free to skip around üëÄ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of folks, I have a bad habit of starting projects and then completely abandoning them for the next big thing. I actually managed to launch 2 iOS apps last year, and 2 Android apps the year before that. Funny enough, I‚Äôve spent the last year doing more web application development than mobile, and I figured it‚Äôs time that my side project portfolio reflected that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to create a web app that accomplished a few goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force me to learn something üìö&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Show off my skills in web application development üßë‚Äçüíª&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solved a problem I face (more on this later) üëÄ&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Makes me some money üí∞&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I wanted to actually launch the application and get it in the hands of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;starting-with-the-problem&quot;&gt;Starting With The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm a college student, and spent a lot of time in the last few years looking for jobs and internships. Right now, a lot of my skillset is in Ruby on Rails, so I was looking for jobs where I could leverage and build on that. So even though it‚Äôs not an incredibly complex application, I decide to build a job board niched into Ruby on Rails developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs are two existing job boards in this space that solve the problem, but the design and experience leaves something to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are actually two distinct kinds of people that use a job boards: Those looking to find a job and those looking to post a job. This obviously brings up the issue of needing enough seekers to support the posters and vice-versa. To counteract this, I decided to make job posting free for now, and soon I‚Äôll be posting jobs myself to add value for job-seekers. Once I‚Äôve built up enough of a consistent userbase, I‚Äôll flip the switch on Stripe and start charging employers to post a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;starting-development-of-a-saas-application&quot;&gt;Starting Development of a SaaS Application&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically enough, I used Ruby on Rails to build the job board. I started by generating a new Rails application (yay Rails 6!) and integrating &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/&quot;&gt;TailwindCSS&lt;/a&gt;. Tailwind is a utilitity CSS framework that I‚Äôm leveraging to make consistently pleasant designs with an incredible pace. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it for almost any project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I implemented an authentication system so that users could create an account and log in or log out. I followed that up by creating a Job model and both the views and the logic for users to Create, Read, Update, or Delete (CRUD) jobs. This is a pretty simple application from that respect, so up til this point was only an hour or so of work ü•≥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-experience-improvements&quot;&gt;User Experience Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I was using Tailwind, my views kind of sucked at this point. I have views for creating an account, logging in, viewing all the jobs, viewing an individual job, editing a job, or creating a job. I spent a great deal of time iterating on this and I‚Äôm still trying to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs one of the earlier versions of the homepage. It‚Äôs pretty emoji-heavy üòÖ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*olLY9y8RVbtQUSWhk7on7g.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I settled on making the root of the page (the landing page) the index for job postings. So when you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.findrailswork.com&quot;&gt;www.findrailswork.com&lt;/a&gt; , you‚Äôll immediately see job postings sorted by recent postings. I figured this is the most valuable page on the site, so I might as well make it the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added markdown support for job descriptions, so folks posting the job can customize it a bit. I also swapped out some colors and made it more remote friendly. Front-end design is a lot of work and I don‚Äôt know how everyone gets so good at it. In time I suppose. I also truncated job descriptions so the cards for postings wouldn‚Äôt go on forever, swapped all the button colors for a fun gradient, and styled the headline with that same gradient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all that, it looks like this as of the time of writing, though I‚Äôm still rapidly iterating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*x2LElP8vfhJ7UYIcUFe6aw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deployment&quot;&gt;Deployment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I did something completely outside my comfort zone and actually deployed the application to production! This is daunting, and nothing like sending an app to the Android or iOS App Stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I registered the domain with Google domains for $12 a year, and figured all of this learning was worth at least $12 even if the project completely flopped. Next, I used my student discount to get 2 free years of a Hobby Dyno with Heroku. (If you‚Äôre a college student, checkout the Github Student Pack, it‚Äôs mindblowing and completely free)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to have been tracking the project with Git from the beginning, so deploying wasn‚Äôt too bad. I had to swap out my sqlite3 database for postgres, but that didn‚Äôt take too much work. I also had to fix a Tailwind bug, but inside of 2 hours my app was live on my domain for the world to see :) After 2 days of banging my head against the wall, I created a very minimal but functional product and put it on the internet for anyone to use. I was eletated and still am at how accessible this is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far the site has cost me $12/year for the domain and $0 for the next 2 years to host, after which it will cost $7/mo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;production-app-nice-to-haves&quot;&gt;Production App Nice-to-Haves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that my application was in production, there were some things I wanted to have settled before I spent any time looking for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I automated deployments. I setup Heroku with a Github Action to detect any new commits on the main branch and automatically trigger a deployment. This has already saved me time and it‚Äôs so fun to just &lt;em&gt;git push&lt;/em&gt; and have my app update less than a minute later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not immune to bugs, in fact I write plenty of bugs. I wanted to know when my üí© code was affecting my users so I added Honeybadger. Honeybadger took less than 5 minutes to add to my app, and will send me an email with a detailed crash report anytime there‚Äôs an error in production. Plus they have a fun name. I don‚Äôt have a lot of errors (yet), so Honeybadger is free for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to know how my users were using my app, and how my changes to it are received. I wanted an analytics solution that didn‚Äôt invade user‚Äôs privacy. I‚Äôve heard a lot of good things about &lt;a href=&quot;https://plausible.io/&quot;&gt;Plausible&lt;/a&gt;, but I wasn‚Äôt quite ready to go for their pricing. I went with &lt;a href=&quot;https://splitbee.io/&quot;&gt;Splitbee&lt;/a&gt;, which respects user privacy, has really easy-to-understand analytics, wonderful design, and happens to be free for my traffic level!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*C_yGmMPeLBbYT2j3nx2iUA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also added an administrative tool that essentially acts as a GUI wrapper for the Rails console so that I can manipulate database data quickly if something catastrophic requires my intervention. This hasn‚Äôt come in handy yet but I have a feeling that at some point I‚Äôll be grateful it‚Äôs already there. Again, free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs Next&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs only been a week, and I have a lot planned for this app. It‚Äôs a pretty basic CRUD app with a really solid foundation to build off, so I‚Äôm excited to see where it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I‚Äôd like to make the job board itself a little more usable. I plan on adding filters for job seekers to filter by remote, salary, location, and more. I also want to add an automated mailer that will send a weekly email to subscribers with any new postings, but I don‚Äôt know where to begin with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application certainly needs a lot of search-engine-optimization in order to show up in search results. I figure the best way to start ranking when people search of Rails jobs is to become a valuable place to look for Rails jobs! That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll be adding jobs myself for quite a while to keep the job board up to date, and I also added a resources page that I‚Äôll fill with tutorials and blogs about becoming a better Rails developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point along the way, I‚Äôll integrate Stripe to handle user payments. I figure recruiters will want to see some data on their ROI, so I want to wait until analytics show between 300‚Äì600 hits a month, or 10‚Äì20 a day. I plan to use Stripe Checkout and just charge a single fee for job postings. Still debating on pricing so if you have any ideas let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôd mean a lot to me if you checked out &lt;a href=&quot;http://findrailswork.com&quot;&gt;RailsWork&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think. You can follow along with the app‚Äôs development progress by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JeffMorhous&quot;&gt;following me on twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getrevue.co/profile/jeffmorhous&quot;&gt;subscribing to my newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Use Swift‚Äôs Ternary Operator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ternary operators are beyond cool. They‚Äôre an easy way to do some if-else logic all on one line. Beyond that, they‚Äôre still easy to read and understand, so you don‚Äôt have to sacrifice readability for the ‚Äòcool factor‚Äô of using a language‚Äôs advanced features. In fact, it‚Äôs a great way to keep methods shorter and draw attention to other logic that may be more meaningful to your program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-with-an-if-else-statement&quot;&gt;Start With An If-Else Statement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the below code for example. You compare two variables, and print something based on the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
5
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;if variable1 == variable2 {
    print(&quot;Equality! ü•≥&quot;)
} else {
    print(&quot;NO EQUALITY ü§¨&quot;)
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;convert-it-to-one-line&quot;&gt;Convert It To One Line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ternary operator consists of 3 parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A conditional check&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The result of the operation if the conditional is true&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The result of the operation if the conditional is false&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our above if-else statement, we could write it like this üëá&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;print(variable1 == variable2 ? &quot;Equality! ü•≥&quot; : &quot;NO EQUALITY ü§¨&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assigning-a-value&quot;&gt;Assigning A Value&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ternary operations in Swift aren‚Äôt limited to just print statements. In fact, the ternary operator returns a value which can be used to set a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could take the below check for the age to drink alcohol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;var result = ‚Äú‚Äù

if(age &amp;lt; 21){  
  result = &quot;Too young to drink üç∫&quot;  
} else {  
  result = &quot;Old enough to drink üçª&quot;  
}

print(result)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a lot of code to just assign a string based on a number value. We can use the ternary operator to do this in just 2 lines‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand you can see the example below üëá&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;let result = age &amp;gt; 21 ? &quot;Too young to drink üç∫&quot;&quot; : &quot;Old enough to drink üçª&quot;
print(result)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        <title>Should I Major in Computer¬†Science?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm in my fourth year studying Computer Science (and Engineering ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), and I‚Äôm certain this was the right move for me. But is a degree in Computer Science the right path for you? Is Computer Science a good major?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the decision was all but obvious once I eliminated some other career options‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI love to build things, and I love to work with people. Working as a Software Engineer seems like a natural choice. The most common degree for people pursuing a career in Software Engineering is a B.S. in Computer Science, so that‚Äôs what I looked for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;should-you-follow-your-passion&quot;&gt;Should you follow your passion?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, and no. Following your passion is often dangerous, as Cal Newport argues in his book, ‚ÄúSo Good They Can‚Äôt Ignore You.‚Äù A distinguished Professor of Computer Science and popular author, he argues that skills trump passion in the quest for work that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the most basic level, we work for money. We used to have to hunt or grow our own food, fending for all of our most basic resources. Now, most of us specialize in more specific work, like carpentry, teaching, marketing, or programming. We trade our time and skills for money, which we trade for the things we want and need. You can talk all day about doing a job because we love it, but if the paycheck stopped coming, I‚Äôd bet you‚Äôd be looking for a job you loved &lt;em&gt;that payed you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, no person &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to spend a giant portion of their life slaving away doing work they hate. We gravitate towards work that fulfills us. &lt;strong&gt;So to answer the question ‚ÄúShould I major in Computer Science,‚Äù you have to answer the question, ‚ÄúWill this lead me to a career that is fulfilling, stable, and financially attractive?‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt; Obviously, the answer varies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I hope to help you find yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport follows up his denial of ‚ÄúFollow your passion‚Äù with the assertion that in order to find work that fulfills us, we need to first acquire rare and valuable skills, something he calls ‚ÄúCareer capital.‚Äù You need to give employers or clients a reason to trust you with autonomy and pay you well, and for that, you need a track record of success. For some people, college is a great step to establishing that track record while acquiring those rare and valuable skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-you-enjoy-working-in-computer-science&quot;&gt;Will You Enjoy Working In Computer Science?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to pick your major (and know if you even &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to go to college) is to decide on your career. Plenty of people find their career after they pick a school and major, and that‚Äôs just as valid. However, if you‚Äôre already considering Computer Science, narrowing down your desired occupation is a natural first step. Here‚Äôs a list of just 10 job titles people in Computer Science tend to gravitate to -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software Developer (or Engineer)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Database Administrator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer Hardware Engineer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer Hardware Engineer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer Hardware Engineer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web Developer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information Security Analyst&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer and Information Research Scientists&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer and Information Systems Managers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IT Project Manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of these roles interest you, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalancecareers.com/top-jobs-for-computer-science-majors-2059634&quot;&gt;find more information here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these titles are great places to start in your search for work that you‚Äôll love, if you feel inclined to them. Even so, you‚Äôll need to work hard and build a reputation for yourself before you reap most of the benefits of this ‚Äúcareer capital.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-you-like-to-code&quot;&gt;Do You Like To Code?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone who studies computer science is writing code all day. In fact, pretty much everyone will have to face more soft-skill oriented tasks, like participating in meetings and working with colleagues. However I‚Äôm pretty comfortable saying that if you don‚Äôt like computers, or the thought of sitting in front of a computer for most of your workday is dreadful, this probably isn‚Äôt the career you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my internships, I spent a lot of time writing code, but even more time working with teammates. Programming isn‚Äôt a solo sport, and that‚Äôs a good thing. So, if you‚Äôre great at working with people, and you don‚Äôt hate computers, give yourself a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-if-youre-bad-at-math&quot;&gt;What If You‚Äôre Bad At Math?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in tech or software is one thing, but studying Computer Science is another. In my professional work, I pretty much never explicitly call on my math knowledge. An understanding of mathematics at an algebra level is likely enough for you to be able to write quality software, but it won‚Äôt make you a ‚ÄúComputer Scientist.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any accredited Computer Science degree is going to require a ton of math. Like, enough math where it wouldn‚Äôt be much extra work to pick up a math minor. You don‚Äôt have to love math to succeed, I certainly don‚Äôt. In fact, I‚Äôm not even particularly good at math. I failed Calculus 3 actually‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI had to take it again. I worked hard, filled gaps in my knowledge, and came out of it with an A. While that one failed course hurt my GPA, I honestly don‚Äôt believe it indicates that I‚Äôm any worse at my job. I view it as a learning experience, and a refinement of my work ethic. Math is really hard for me, and I work my butt off to get through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I graduate, I can move on from math. Sure, jobs will often you to understand Computer Science related math (things like graph theory, limits, and maybe even probability), but I believe employers value work ethic over natural ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do have to command an ability in analytical thinking though. Programming is just telling computers what to do, and that requires a firm grasp on logic. This is something that can be learned, but if you absolutely hate the idea of puzzles, logic, and problem solving, you‚Äôre starting at an incredible disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard. So no, don‚Äôt let not ‚Äúbeing a math person‚Äù stop you from pursuing a career you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-other-majors&quot;&gt;What About Other Majors?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided on my major and on my school at the same time, and I would definitely recommend that to anyone who hasn‚Äôt graduated high school yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a career in software is exciting to you, you don‚Äôt exactly have to study Computer Science. In fact, a diverse background makes for a strong team, and if you can learn the technical skills on your own, a different major won‚Äôt work too much against you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happens to be a bit easier to land an entry level job in software when you have a piece of paper that at least says, ‚ÄúI passed a lot of tests about skills this job requires,‚Äù so there is definitely value in studying relevant to the job you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-decide-if-cs-is-the-right-major&quot;&gt;How To Decide If CS Is The Right Major&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet you came here looking for me to say ‚ÄúYes you should major in CS‚Äù, or ‚ÄúNo, you shouldn‚Äôt even go to college,‚Äù but I‚Äôm not going to do that. Sorry ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your career is an exceptionally personal journey, but it shouldn‚Äôt define you. Figure out what‚Äôs important to you in work. Decide how you want your days to look. If that aligns with a job like Software Engineering, that‚Äôs great! It‚Äôs even better if some of your skills align with the job, like an aptitude for computers, programming experience, and analytical proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech jobs are in very high demand, meaning you‚Äôll posses &lt;em&gt;rare and valuable skills&lt;/em&gt; that will often translate to job security and financial rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a huge shortage in computer science talent, which places a premium on these skills. For me, wearing a hoodie to work, or even working from my bedroom, are pretty much the best perks on the planet. Don‚Äôt even get me started on free food üòù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you do major in Computer Science, college won‚Äôt teach you everything you need to know. You need to be always learning and growing, even after you start your first ‚Äòreal‚Äô job.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Interview With a Self-Taught iOS Developer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the tweet that I‚Äôd been waiting for since I started following Frank back in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;BIG NEWS!!!: After 2 years of self study, 5 months of unemployment, a global pandemic, having 3 kids (two are twins!), 100+ applications and countless interviews I can finally say I‚Äôve accepted my first job as a Mobile Software Engineer!!!! üéâü•≥ I FREAKING DID IT!!!! üôå&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Frank Foster | #BlackLivesMatter (@frankefoster) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/frankefoster/status/1302313561696301057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 5, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank comes from an IT background, and landed an iOS development job in the middle of 2020. Heck of a year for a career change. About a month ago, he agreed to sit down with me and talk about his journey to becoming a Mobile Software Engineer, and his story is definitely worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the beginning of your career like? How did you break into tech without a degree?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I actually, funny enough, used to work at Apple. I was a genius at one of the Apple stores. I worked there for about 6 years, starting at sales and working my way up to genius, which is pretty much everything. Towards the end of my time there, I said ‚ÄúYou know what, I need a change of pace, I‚Äôm going to start coding.‚Äù I poked around, initially looking at game development. I started off with all the worst preconceptions of how great I was gonna be, and found out very quickly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚ÄúOh no, this is not easy.‚Äù It was super hard. I ended up switching to an IT job, and did that for about two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I came across an opportunity from University of Idaho‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey had partnered with Apple to offer free coding classes to the community, and they were looking for someone to run it. So I figured, ‚ÄúWhat better way to learn than by teaching!‚Äù That was in 2018, and I eventually left my IT job, and went to a better IT job at a pretty mature startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shortly into the work-from-home stuff, the company I was working at was hit with layoffs. At this point, I‚Äôd been doing this teaching coding thing for a few years. I figured I either go back to another IT job, which I won‚Äôt enjoy, or I can jump into iOS development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how did your job search start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I had a few apps under my belt, but I still took a few months to study, work on my own apps, and work on my twitter, LinkedIn, and Resume. There‚Äôs definitely an element of being known, creating some legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Twitter fit into your story?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Twitter went from this thing where I knew I had to do it for my career, to genuinely enjoying the community. That‚Äôs how I met you, and that‚Äôs how I met a number of people‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôve even been to a couple twitter dev meetups!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did you start applying for a new job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I probably started kicking off my applications about two months after I was laid off. I applied at probably 80‚Äì90 companies. My daily routine was just get up, go to LinkedIn and Indeed, and just apply constantly. I had 4 0r 5 interviews, and 3 of them I had a second round with. (Writers note, this is an awesome interview success rate. Frank rocks at interviewing)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I really connected with the company I‚Äôm with now. Of all the opportunities I could have taken, I‚Äôm sure this is the best. There‚Äôs a ton of opportunity for me to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you get started learning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I started with Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúEveryone can Code‚Äù free materials, which is what Inspire Idaho was using as a curriculum. It kind of gave the ground level, and my class expanded on that to build out real apps. It‚Äôs important to pick something that you want to build, even if it‚Äôs super basic. Something like a button that changes a color can teach you a lot. I definitely tapped into Hacking With Swift, 100 Days of Swift, and everything that Paul Hudson has done. Building an app is really important. Realizing, I want to do ‚Äòthis‚Äô&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; and then seeking out the resources and gaining the necessary knowledge to build it. I couldn‚Äôt list every tutorial I followed, or every Medium/Reddit/Blog/Stack Overflow post I read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are you continuing to build on your foundation of knowledge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oh my gosh, dude, it‚Äôs a daily thing. One of the challenges I‚Äôm facing right now is learning dependency injection, and doing that on a deadline is a bit stressful. I‚Äôm on a small team, and my coworkers are amazing. My teammate has been taking time to bring me up to speed, but there‚Äôs still a lot I don‚Äôt know. You kind of have to take it as a learning opportunity, write down things to remember, and try to use new knowledge to solidify it. I might go a little bit slower than a coworker, but all the work I do gives me a building block to keep going. When you find the right company, you‚Äôre not less of an employee for having gaps in knowledge. Having open sourced projects on Github helps set expectations for companies going in too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What‚Äôs the best part of being an iOS Developer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a lot of great things! For most of my career, I‚Äôve been in a customer-service type position, where I do things for customers. There‚Äôs only so many ways you can reset a password or replace a hard drive. You go from that, to being &lt;strong&gt;creative&lt;/strong&gt; with things. It definitely brings a new perspective, combining logic and design. We don‚Äôt have a UX Designer, so we get to build both sides of our app. I‚Äôm also a homebody, so being remote is fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähow has remote work been for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was actually kind of remote before this, I was pretty much the only IT person at my company‚Äôs site. I was in an office, but all my meetings and whatnot were on video call, so moving to completely at home has been no problem at all. I like being at home, I‚Äôm lucky enough to have a space that can be my office. I think it‚Äôs great‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI like the fact that there isn‚Äôt someone on top of you cracking the whip, since I‚Äôve had that kind of job before. Especially with coding, I think the isolation helps. To be able to put on some headphones and just focus is great. I‚Äôve actually been thinking about buying some more pairs of sweatpants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What drew you to iOS over any other kind of development? Would you make the same decision if you could go back?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The big thing that drew me to it is that I‚Äôm a huge Apple fan. For all of their flaws, their philosophy of technology is what draws me to using it. In a very weird way, I started college for a music degree, and the Mac was the place to be in that scene. I was homeschooled, and my mom put a lot of schooling me. She was an artist, and that left a huge impact on me. Apples intersection of art and technology is super evident. If I could go back, I think I could do it again. There‚Äôs all sorts of products and technologies that you could learn, like game development, or the web, but I think for now iOS is the place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about cross-platform stuff, like React Native? Would you ever switch into that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt have a huge opinion because I haven‚Äôt used it enough. But I definitely believe in using the best technology for the job at hand. Knowing the hatred of React Native in a lot of the community, I do think that native code is better. You‚Äôre able to follow guidelines for that platform much closer, and your development time often ends up being faster anyways. Being as native as possible often gives the best experience for users, but it still depends on what you‚Äôre doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Why You Can't Focus</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Being able to devote your full attention to something is fundamental to thriving in any area of life, so why is it so hard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Cal Newport‚Äôs cult-favorite ‚ÄúDeep Work‚Äù, he says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, ‚ÄúDeep Work‚Äù is putting all of our energy into one task, to accomplish something that can‚Äôt easily be replicated. Think of the last time you had to write a term paper, study for a math exam, or complete a deliverable at work. If you‚Äôre anything like me, you probably remember the constant negotiation with yourself to actually work on the task at hand. I often find myself wanting to reach for my phone, grab a snack, water my succulent, honestly anything but what I‚Äôve set out to do. Of course, guilt quickly follows. Does that make me a bad person/student/programmer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. &lt;strong&gt;Everyone experiences resistance to mentally or physically taxing labor to some extent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;novel-stimuli&quot;&gt;Novel stimuli&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human brain is wired to  &lt;strong&gt;seek out novel stimuli&lt;/strong&gt;. It‚Äôs simply how we‚Äôve stayed alive for so long. When a deer runs into the road while we‚Äôre driving, our attention instantly shifts to it, prompting us to act to avoid the danger. That same instinctual response to new and interesting things in our surroundings is what makes it so hard to get focused work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mind is always on the lookout for something more interesting than what it‚Äôs currently honed in on. The same thing that keeps you alive is to blame for  &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt;  all procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overcoming-it&quot;&gt;Overcoming It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a careful balance necessary between work that is too boring and work that is too hard. If you can convince yourself that you‚Äôre interested in something, and work enough to understand it, all that‚Äôs left to do is devote your attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there‚Äôs lots of things we can do to get into a flow state of hyper-focused attention easier. For me, it‚Äôs all about routine. When I set out to do truly deep work, I like to sit down with a drink (pop, tea, coffee, etc), put on some headphones, and get to work. I try not to sit at a desk with music and tea unless I‚Äôm doing work, so when I start that routine my mind already knows what‚Äôs about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any skill,  &lt;strong&gt;practice works wonders&lt;/strong&gt;. 
Think of the time you spend focusing as an investment in any future time you need to focus. Each time it get‚Äôs a little easier to fight off distractions for just a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Switching From iPad to iPad¬†Pro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been using an iPad for about 3 years, and I absolutely love it. Too often I hear tech-enthusiasts blast it as an underpowered toy computer for grandmothers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand &lt;em&gt;wow&lt;/em&gt; is that underselling it. For the most part, I‚Äôve used my iPad as a leisure device. Since most of my work and education is done on a computer, it‚Äôs nice to feel a little separation when I want to unwind with something digital. The more I used it though, the more likely I was to reach for my iPad for professional tasks. When my college went 100% online back in March, it became a precious part of my workflow. Since I almost use my iPad more than my computer (except on workdays.. 8 hours of screen time is plenty), I made the jump over to the iPad pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, there aren‚Äôt dozens of selling points to go with an iPad pro over the regular iPad, especially since the base iPad now supports Apple Pencil. But I‚Äôm still glad I did it! There are however inarguable improvements that make the iPad Pro a joy to own and use for leisure, work, and school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;apple-pencil-2&quot;&gt;Apple Pencil 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apple Pencil 2 is no doubt better than the original. For some reason, the base iPad is only comparable with the original Apple Pencil. They really listened to every complaint about their first generation pencil and solved pretty much all of them. For starters, this generation of the pencil magnetically attaches to the side of the iPad Pro for super convenient storage and &lt;strong&gt;charging&lt;/strong&gt;! Beyond that, the pencil is no longer &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; round. Since it sports one flat edge, the pencil is less prone to roll off the table onto the floor. You make think that‚Äôs a minor issue, but I can testify that my Apple Pencil 1 would roll onto the floor during a lecture at least a few times a week. In the ‚Äúreal‚Äù pencil world, you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find one that is completely round. Lastly, the pencil has a touch sensor, which apps can customize to allow actions (like tool switching) with just a tap on the side of the pencil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;usb-c&quot;&gt;USB-C&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This right here&lt;/em&gt; is a crowd favorite. The original iPad (and every iPhone to date) charges with Apple‚Äôs proprietary ‚ÄúLightning‚Äù connector. The iPad Pro on the other hand uses the ubiquitous ‚ÄúUSB-C‚Äù connector that‚Äôs become popular on smartphones, computers (including MacBooks), and tablets around the world. Again, a very small but welcome improvement. If you‚Äôre wondering why it matters, I can now leave the house with my iPad and MacBook, and &lt;em&gt;1 cord to charge them both&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;screen-size&quot;&gt;Screen Size&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screen size and lack of bezel is the first thing you‚Äôll notice if you put an iPad and a Pro next to each other. The iPad I switched from was a 10.2 inch, while the iPad Pro I switched to is an 11 inch. This doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot of difference on paper, but the trimmed bezel makes it feel like a whole different class of device. Combine this with the square edges (as opposed to rounded on the base iPad), and it‚Äôs easy to see the iPad Pro in a class of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;display-quality&quot;&gt;Display Quality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base level iPad sports 264 pixels per inch with 500 nits brightness. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro boasts 264 pixels per inch with 600 nits of brightness. The Pro‚Äôs display also comes with a fully laminated display with anti-reflective coating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in less technical terms, the two iPads have the same resolution, but the Pro comes with an optionally brighter display that is also laminated and reduces glare. The difference here is marginal, but it‚Äôs definitely noticeable and worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stereo-speakers&quot;&gt;Stereo Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually had no idea of this until I was watching Netflix on the iPad Pro one evening. The base level iPad has some speakers on one end of it, and they‚Äôre nothing to write home about. (the reader may note that here I am, writing about it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). On the other hand, the Pro comes with 4 speakers. When holding it in landscape mode, there are &lt;em&gt;2 speakers on each side of the device.&lt;/em&gt; I can‚Äôt imagine taking much advantage of this serendipitous stereo discovery, but it‚Äôs another subtle difference that separates this iPad into its own class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;face-id&quot;&gt;Face ID&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base level iPad comes with Touch ID, a fingerprint sensor used to unlock the iPad and authenticate for various transactions. But much like newer iPhones, the iPad Pro comes with Face ID, which lets you authenticate by just looking at the iPad. Am I lazy for loving this? Maybe, but it certainly makes using a password manager the easiest thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lidar&quot;&gt;LiDAR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one really knows why LiDAR was included in this years revision of the iPad Pro, but no one is complaining. LiDAR is an additional sensor that acts like radar but uses lasers. Already, this enables the device to deliver next-generation augmented reality experiences. Not many apps take advantage of this yet, but consider this a future-proofing hardware enhancement. Already, apps like Ikea let you see how furniture would look in your house. While this experience is delivered on most iOS devices, the LiDAR sensor makes them darn close to flawless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPad Pro definitely deserves it‚Äôs ‚ÄúPro‚Äù name, even if it‚Äôs not obvious at first glance. All of these subtle improvements over the base model really pull together for a best-in-class experience. I definitely won‚Äôt tell you which iPad to buy, but I‚Äôm super happy with the Pro üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Switching To The Brave¬†Browser</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been using Chrome since around its release, but ditched it last year over privacy concerns. Google has a really big interest in having its eye on everything you do online so it can find a way to profit off of it, which was a little frustrating for me. After some experimenting, I ended up on Safari, which touted some pretty sweet privacy features, mostly in the area of blocking website‚Äôs attempts to follow you across the web. This worked out for a while, but I ended up having to keep Chrome installed, because &lt;em&gt;a shockingly high amount of websites only bother checking to make sure things work in Chrome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole experience of trying to avoid Chrome has definitely been frustrating, but I‚Äôve stuck to it mostly out of spite. A month or so ago, I discovered Brave, and have been loving it. It works and feels like Chrome, but protects your privacy like Firefox or Safari. Beyond that, it even has some decent ad-blocking features and an interesting method for ensuring creators continue to get paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should at least check it out, so here‚Äôs a few highlights to make it easier on you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chromium&quot;&gt;Chromium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromium is a free, open source browser from Google itself üò±&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chromium shouldn‚Äôt be confused with Chrome, which is one of Google‚Äôs most impressive pieces of spyware. Chromium is a bare-bones web browser that &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; can expand upon. Google uses Chromium as the basis for Chrome, and Brave uses Chromium as the basis for itself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing the engine with Chromium provides a ton of benefits. Let‚Äôs be honest‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämost of the world uses Chrome as it‚Äôs default browser. It‚Äôs gone so far as to become a meme that Safari/Edge are only used to install Chrome and then never touched again. The downside to this is that people who build websites, tend to make them work best on Chrome. I‚Äôve had plenty of problems with websites in Safari, including Youtube and Netflix üòí&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Brave is built on the same skeleton that Chrome is, &lt;strong&gt;websites work as if you were using Chrome&lt;/strong&gt;. Even further, &lt;strong&gt;you can use Chrome Extensions!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ad-blocking&quot;&gt;Ad Blocking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad blocking is the thing that brings most people to the Brave browser. Brave blocks harmful ads that try to identify and track you across the internet. Yes you‚Äôll still see ads, but you can expect them to be fewer and further between. When you do see an ad, it is far less likely to be trying to identify you at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want, you can also opt-in to Brave‚Äôs custom ads. The company recognizes that advertisements enable creators to make content for everyone to enjoy, and just making advertisements vanish isn‚Äôt fair to everyone. You can choose to see occasional ads served up by the browser itself, and they will distribute a portion of the earnings from those advertisements to participating creators across the web. So if you spend all your time reading the New York Times, the idea is for that site to get all of the revenue generated by the advertisements you see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tracker-blocking&quot;&gt;Tracker Blocking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond ad-blocking, Brave also blocks many attempts by websites to identify and exploit you. It starts by blocking fingerprinting techniques, which is where a website will collect as much information about you as possible, that it can identify your return visits even if you delete cookies and use a VPN. Brave goes one step further and stops cross-site cookies, which are yet another attempt for a website to observe your behavior &lt;em&gt;after you leave the website&lt;/em&gt; üòí&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-browsing-with-tor&quot;&gt;Private Browsing With Tor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want, Brave will let you browse using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29&quot;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;, which is an open-source system for anonymous communication. In short, it works by routing requests through multiple servers and encrypting it each step of the way. Today it is maintained by its own non-profit, which states the following about it‚Äôs use -&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We, at the Tor Project, fight every day for everyone to have private access to an uncensored internet, and Tor has become the world‚Äôs strongest tool for privacy and freedom online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, all that to say, Brave‚Äôs private browsing is a whole lot more private than Chrome‚Äôs ‚Äúprivate‚Äù browsing. I‚Äôve not actually used this feature though, as routing things through Tor slows your experience substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        <title>My Favorite Productivity Tips</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If a craftsman wants to do good work, he must first sharpen his tools.‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäConfucius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In math words, productivity typically is units of output per unit of time. Talking about our own work that way makes us feel like machines, and is a bit too reductionist. When I think of productivity, I think about getting done what I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to get done in time so that I can do what I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to get done. However you define it, productivity matters to you whether you‚Äôre a student, knowledge worker, parent, landscaper, or anything in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;em&gt;freelancer&lt;/em&gt;, increasing my productivity has allowed me to increase the amount of money I can make per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;em&gt;student&lt;/em&gt;, focusing on productivity ensures that I stay on top of my coursework while still enjoying the meaningful things in life, like walks in the woods with my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I‚Äôve compiled a list of my favorite productivity tips that I‚Äôve discovered in the last few years, and I hope you find them as helpful as I have.‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;daily-highlight-&quot;&gt;Daily Highlight üîç&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is concept is pretty new to me, and it comes from the book ‚ÄúMake Time‚Äù by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. They advocate for picking a single priority for the day and putting as much energy as possible into it. As someone who typically makes obsessively detailed lists for my days, this is a little bit odd to me‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSo of course I tried it out for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QR8pokk11W5EEBI0jOzgGA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Reading ‚ÄúMake Time‚Äù with a view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book (which I cannot recommend enough), the authors explain that todo lists aren‚Äôt focused enough, and long term goals are too hard to measure progress towards. Whenever you sit down to do work, whatever that looks like for your occupation, you should &lt;strong&gt;write down the one thing that matters most to you for the time you‚Äôre about to spend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been doing this for about 2 weeks now, and it‚Äôs helped me in a few different ways. For one, it keeps me honest and focused on what matters most. I‚Äôm far less likely to get sucked into reading documentation when I know my highlight for the day is to ‚ÄúFinish Writing New Tests‚Äù. But beyond that, &lt;em&gt;it gives me greater satisfaction as I stop working for the day.&lt;/em&gt; Even if I miss some other todo items, it‚Äôs remarkably rewarding to set out what I accomplish to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend setting a highlight at the beginning of your work/school times. If the concept interests you more, then you‚Äôd enjoy the book! &lt;em&gt;They don‚Äôt give me anything for saying that&lt;/em&gt; ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deep-work-&quot;&gt;Deep Work ü§´&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport (there‚Äôs that name again ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) says ‚ÄòDeep work‚Äô is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. He has a lot of things to say on the subject, so much so that he wrote a whole book about it. In the aptly titled ‚ÄúDeep Work‚Äù he argues that our constantly distracting digital tools stop us from getting meaningful work done in normal quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the idea is that you do your best work when you‚Äôre completely focused on one thing for an extended period of time. If you say, need to write a 5 page paper, that‚Äôs deep work. Checking your email however, is ‚Äúshallow work.‚Äù In the past, I‚Äôve broken down tasks like writing a 5 page paper into small intervals to make it manageable, but this often leads to lost time and a lower quality product, as your brain is spending too much time going in and out of the deep work ‚Äúzone.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to approach something with deep work, is to schedule some time for it, a process called ‚Äútime blocking,‚Äù and then focus on that thing, eliminating distractions like notifications or meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a pretty cool startup called Clockwise that produces a tool that will automatically rearrange your meetings (and subsequently, your colleague‚Äôs calendars) to allow you as large of a contiguous block of free time as possible to get deep work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs my favorite blog post that explains more on deep work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doist.com/blog/deep-work/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Work: The Complete Guide (Including a Step-by-Step Checklist)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pomodoro-&quot;&gt;Pomodoro ‚è∞&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pomodoro is my go-to strategy for getting myself moving when I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don‚Äôt want to. Inertia extends beyond a force of nature and into our professional lives. If we‚Äôre already really productive, it tends to be nice and easy to do the next task. If we‚Äôve been slugging around for a while, it can become incredibly hard just to get moving on that first thing. However, once most people get started, they find that getting past that initial friction is all they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pomodoro relies on the inertia rule of productivity to get things done in short intervals with breaks as a reward system. The idea is you set a work timer, typically for 25 minutes, and focus on one task for the entire period. Then, you take a 5 minute break to be a sloth again and repeat as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work for 25 minutes, take a five minute break.&lt;/strong&gt; If you do this twice, you will have accomplished 50 minutes of high quality work in just 1 hour, which is a win no matter how you look at it. This technique conflicts a bit with the philosophy of deep work given it advocates for short time periods, but it does protect your attention while you work, which is an absolute must. Most importantly, it gets you over that initial friction from getting started. It‚Äôs really hard to convince yourself to study for 4 hours, but it‚Äôs really easy to convince yourself to study for 25 minutes ü§î&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;regular-sleep-&quot;&gt;Regular Sleep üò¥&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep can make you more productive. It always seems like sleep can be a waste of time, right? I mean, to sleep 8 hours a night, we spend 1/3rd of our life &lt;em&gt;unconscious&lt;/em&gt;. How can that be productive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of sleep that way is a bit too reductionist. While we sleep, our brain does the necessary work to decompress, rest, and shift things from short term to long term storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the negative effects on your well-being, if you don‚Äôt sleep enough, or you sleep inconsistently, you will surely suffer professionally. I‚Äôve found that sleeping 7‚Äì8 hours a night, every night, helps me to feel focused and healthy, freeing me to do my best work and enjoy life without having to make too many sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt look at sleep as a waste of time, but look at it as the best way to take care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;task-management-&quot;&gt;Task Management üë®‚Äçüî¨&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entire books have been written about task management, and dozens of applications are out there to help refine it. &lt;strong&gt;The single greatest benefit of keeping things you want and need to do in a written or digital system is the bandwidth it frees up in your mind&lt;/strong&gt;. Whenever a thought pops into my head, something like ‚ÄúGet a mothers day card for mom‚Äù, I throw it into my task app and my mind is free to resume doing real work. It seems tiny, but the pressure of trying to remember your responsibilities, no matter how large, can cost you &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any approach to keeping your tasks under control is better than no approach, but I tend to go as organized as possible. I prefer apps over paper, so that I can always access it, and it‚Äôs easy to move things around. Specifically, I use Todoist, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeffmorhous.com/how-i-use-todoist-to-organize-my-life-as-a-student/&quot;&gt;which I‚Äôve written a whole article about.&lt;/a&gt; I throw things into the app as they come into my head, and at the beginning of every week I refine things to make sure each day is manageable in workload. I use the priorities feature to single out my highlight, a nod to my newest tip above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a todo app wouldn‚Äôt help you with your &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt;, it will help you with your &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to be known as dependable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unplug-&quot;&gt;Unplug üîå&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one seems obvious to me. Our minds are constantly stimulated, a condition that we‚Äôve only faced for the last few decades. In his book, ‚ÄúDigital Minimalism,‚Äù Cal Newport advocates for a simple life free of constant digital distraction. Now, you don‚Äôt have to take all his advice, but a big takeaway is the &lt;strong&gt;mental benefit you receive from doing something outside of screens&lt;/strong&gt;, especially if all your work is done on a screen. This means, after a long day at the computer, watching TV isn‚Äôt necessarily the best option for your noggin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things like going on a walk, cooking, and investing in meaningful relationships all pay huge dividends on your productivity. We‚Äôre not built to work all the time, so if you let your work or low-quality leisure consume your life, you‚Äôll find yourself struggling to compete with (and less happy than) your peers who take time to unplug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the thought of unplugging makes you nervous, it‚Äôs a good sign your brain needs that break even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-&quot;&gt;Reading üìñ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading gives you superpowers, simple as that. If you make reading a regular habit, your attention span will increase and strengthen, alongside your rapidly growing reading speed. Beyond that, you also absorb information from whatever you happen to be reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plenty of successful people make reading a priority in their life. Warren Buffet is known to spend 5‚Äì6 hours a day reading, while Bill Gates is known to pour through 50 books a year. When asked about his reading, Buffet said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúRead 500 pages like this every day. That‚Äôs how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading is a wonderfully relaxing and rewarding hobby that will push you towards success faster than any other.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Give Your ViewController An Activity Indicator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;UIKit provides a nifty little spinning wheel we can display to the user when we‚Äôre waiting on something that the user can‚Äôt see. It‚Äôs considered a best practice to pop one of these up when doing something like a network call, so the person using our app isn‚Äôt clueless as to what‚Äôs going on. Basically, you create the spinner, and add it to your view. Then, just before a background task like an API request, tell it to animate. When the background request finishes, you just tell it to stop animating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, declare your spinner in the ViewController&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;var activityIndicator = UIActivityIndicatorView(style: .Large)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside viewDidLoad, or a method called by viewDidLoad, add the spinner to your view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;activityIndicator.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
view.addSubview(activityIndicator)
activityIndicator.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor).isActive = true
activityIndicator.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor).isActive = **true**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you make your background task, start the spinner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;activityIndicator.startAnimating()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And when the background task completes, stop the spinner!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;self.activityIndicator.stopAnimating()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is such a small UI feature that has a huge benefit. If you implement it correctly, the people that use your app will probably never consciously notice it. But if you don‚Äôt implement this, users will likely feel like your app is slow, or mistake a normal wait time for a buggy freeze of the app. Hope you got some value out of this, I know your users will!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Customize UITextView</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So recently I‚Äôve been working on an iOS version of my Mock My Words app. It‚Äôs pretty simple in functionality so I wanted to compensate with a nice user interface. The main functionality requires that a user enter (or paste) in text of pretty much any size. Oftentimes iOS text entry with a  &lt;strong&gt;UITextField&lt;/strong&gt;, but that only offers single line input. For multi-line input, you have to use  &lt;strong&gt;UITextView&lt;/strong&gt;  üòî. After throwing that in my app I was rather unimpressed with how it looked. So, I decided to put my own spin on it. It took a bit of research and I‚Äôm pleased with how it turned out so I thought I‚Äôd share with the community on how customize the UITextView object to your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-the-uitextview&quot;&gt;Create the UITextView&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm building this app programmatically, so the first step is to instantiate the UITextView object. If you‚Äôre using a storyboard, you‚Äôll want to create an IBOutlet and then follow the other steps the same. I declared my UITextView at the class level of the view controller it‚Äôs used in, and the one-line looks like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    **let** textBox = UITextView()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note, all of the following code should be executed by  &lt;em&gt;viewdidload()&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but feel free to extract it to a function and then call that function from viewDidLoad()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;add-it-to-the-view&quot;&gt;Add it to the view&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you have to add it to the view hierarchy so it actually shows up. If you‚Äôre using a storyboard, skip this step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    view.addSubview(textBox)textBox.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = **false**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-the-delegate&quot;&gt;Set the delegate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you actually want your app to react to actions the user may take, you need to make your view controller extend UITextViewDelegate, and then have the following line in your configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    textBox.delegate = **self**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;customize-the-textbox&quot;&gt;Customize the textbox&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use creative freedom here, but here‚Äôs how I laid out my textbox view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
5
6
7
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    textBox.autocorrectionType = .no
    textBox.text = placeholderText
    textBox.backgroundColor = .secondarySystemBackground
    textBox.textColor = .secondaryLabel
    textBox.font = UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .body)
    textBox.layer.cornerRadius = 20
    textBox.textContainerInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: 10, left: 10, bottom: 10, right: 10)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-it-a-shadow&quot;&gt;Give it a shadow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this is optional, but this is how I gave my textbox a shadow so it has a material design feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
5
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    textBox.layer.shadowColor = UIColor.gray.cgColor;
    textBox.layer.shadowOffset = CGSize(width: 0.75, height: 0.75)
    textBox.layer.shadowOpacity = 0.4
    textBox.layer.shadowRadius = 20
    textBox.layer.masksToBounds = **false**
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-your-view-where-to-put-it&quot;&gt;Tell your view where to put it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your method for doing this will definitely vary, but I used&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    NSLayoutConstraint.activate([insert your array of constraints here])
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that‚Äôs it! You have a custom textbox that kind of floats above the view you put it in.&lt;/p&gt;
